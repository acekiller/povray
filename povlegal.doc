also.)  All of these are referred to here as "the software". 

THIS NOTICE MUST ACCOMPANY ALL OFFICIAL OR CUSTOM PERSISTENCE OF VISION 
FILES. IT MAY NOT BE REMOVED OR MODIFIED. THIS INFORMATION PERTAINS TO ALL 
USE OF THE PACKAGE WORLDWIDE.  THIS DOCUMENT SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS 
LICENSES OR DISTRIBUTION POLICIES.


                        IMPORTANT LEGAL INFORMATION

Permission is granted to the user to use the Persistence of Vision 
Raytracer and all associated files in this package to create and render 
images. The use of this software for the purpose of creating images is 
free. The creator of a scene file and the image created from the scene 
file, retains all rights to the image and scene file they created and may 
use them for any purpose commercial or noncommercial.  

The user is also granted the right to use the scenes files and include 
files distributed in the INCLUDE and DEMO sub-directories of the POVDOC 
archive when creating their own scenes.  Such permission does not extend to 
files in the POVSCN archive.  POVSCN files are for your enjoyment and 
education but may not be the basis of any derivative works.

This software package and all of the files in this archive are copyrighted 
and may only be distributed and/or modified according to the guidelines 
listed below.  The spirit of the guidelines below is to promote POV-Ray as 
a standard ray tracer, provide the full POV-Ray package freely to as many 
users as possible, prevent POV-Ray users and developers from being taken 
advantage of, enhance the life quality of those who come in contact with 
POV-Ray.  This legal document was created so these goals could be realized.  
You are legally bound to follow these rules, but we hope you will follow 
them as a matter of ethics, rather than fear of litigation.

No portion of this package may be separated from the package and 
distributed separately other than under the conditions specified in the 
guidelines below.  

This package may be bundled in other software packages according to the 
conditions specified in the guidelines below.

This package may be included in software-only compilations using media 
such as, but not limited to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, optical 
disks, hard disks, or memory cards.  There are specific rules and 
guidelines listed below for the provider to follow in order to legally 
offer POV-Ray with a software compilation.

The user is granted the privilege to modify and compile the source for 
their own personal use in any fashion they see fit.  What you do with the 
software in your own home is your business.

If the user wishes to distribute a modified version of the software,
documentation or other parts of the package (here after referred to as 
a "custom version") they must follow the guidelines listed below.  These 
guidelines have been established to promote the growth of POV-Ray and 
prevent difficulties for users and developers alike.  Please follow them 
carefully for the benefit of all concerned when creating a custom version.  

You may not incorporate any portion of the POV-Ray source code in any 
software other than a custom version of POV-Ray.  However authors who 
contribute source to POV-Ray may still retain all rights to use their 
contributed code for any purpose as described below.

The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the POV-Team, 
but the team is in no way required to utilize these enhancements or fixes.  
By sending material to the POV-Team, the contributor asserts that he owns 
the materials or has the right to distribute these materials.  He 
authorizes the POV-Team to use the materials any way they like.  The 
contributor still retains rights to the donated material, but by donating 
you grant equal rights to the POV-Team.  The POV-Team doesn't have to use 
the material, but if we do, you do not acquire any rights related to POV-
Ray.  We will give you credit if applicable.


                    GENERAL RULES FOR ALL DISTRIBUTION

The permission to distribute this package under certain very specific 
conditions is granted in advance, provided that the above and following 
conditions are met.

These archives must not be re-archived using a different method without the 
explicit permission of the POV-Team.  You may rename the archives only to 
meet the file name conventions of your system or to avoid file name 
duplications but we ask that you try to keep file names as similar to the 
originals as possible.  (For example:POVDOC.ZIP to POVDOC20.ZIP)

You must distribute a full package of archives as described in the next 
section.

Noncommercial distribution (such as a user copying the software for a 
personal friend or colleague and not charging money or services for that 
copy) has no other restrictions.  This does not include nonprofit 
organizations or computer clubs. These groups should use the 
Shareware/Freeware distribution company rules below.

The POV-Team reserves the right to withdraw distribution privileges from 
any group, individual, or organization for any reason.


                       DEFINITION OF "FULL PACKAGE"

POV-Ray is contained in 4 archives for each hardware platform.  1) An 
executable archive, 2) A documentation archive, 3) Sample scene archives, 
4) Source code archive.

POV-Ray is officially distributed for IBM-PC compatibles running MS-Dos; 
Apple Macintosh; and Commodore Amiga.  Other systems may be added in the
