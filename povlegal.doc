                             February 1, 1977
                                     
                         GENERAL LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS NOTICE MUST ACCOMPANY ALL OFFICIAL OR CUSTOM PERSISTENCE OF VISION 
FILES. IT MAY NOT BE REMOVED OR MODIFIED. THIS INFORMATION PERTAINS TO ALL 
USE OF THE PACKAGE WORLDWIDE.  THIS DOCUMENT SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS 
GENERAL LICENSES OR DISTRIBUTION POLICIES. ANY INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES OR 
GROUPS WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED SPECIAL LICENSES MAY CONTINUE TO DISTRIBUTE 
VERSION 2.x BUT MUST RE-APPLY FOR VERSION 3.00 OR LATER.

This document pertains to the use and distribution of the Persistence of 
Vision(tm) Ray Tracer a.k.a POV-Ray(tm). It applies to all POV-Ray program 
source files, executable (binary) files, scene files, documentation files, 
help file, bitmaps and INI files contained in official POV-Ray Team(tm) 
archives.  All of these are referred to here as "the software". 
 
All of this software is Copyright 1991,1997 by the POV-Ray Team(tm).  
Although it is distributed as freeware, it is NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN.

The copyrighted package may ONLY be distributed and/or modified according 
to the license granted herein.  The spirit of the license is to promote 
POV-Ray as a standard ray tracer, provide the full POV-Ray package freely 
to as many users as possible, prevent POV-Ray users and developers from 
being taken advantage of, enhance the life quality of those who come in 
contact with POV-Ray.  This license was created so these goals could be 
realized.  You are legally bound to follow these rules, but we hope you 
will follow them as a matter of ethics, rather than fear of litigation.


                             USAGE PROVISIONS

Permission is granted to the user to use the software and associated files 
in this package to create and render images. The use of this software for 
the purpose of creating images is completely free. The creator of a scene 
file and the image created from the scene file, retains all rights to the 
image and scene file they created and may use them for any purpose 
commercial or noncommercial.  

The user is also granted the right to use the scenes files, fonts, bitmaps, 
and include files distributed in the INCLUDE, TEXSAMPS and POV3DEMO sub-
directories in their own scenes.  Such permission does not extend to files 
in the POVSCN sub-directory.  POVSCN files are for your enjoyment and 
education but may not be the basis of any derivative works.


                    GENERAL RULES FOR ALL DISTRIBUTION

The permission to distribute this package under certain very specific 
conditions is granted in advance, provided that the following conditions 
are met.  

These archives must not be re-archived using a different method without the 
explicit permission of the POV-Team.  You may rename the archives only to 
meet the file name conventions of your system or to avoid file name 
duplications but we ask that you try to keep file names as similar to the 
originals as possible.  (For example:POVSRC.ZIP to POVSRC30.ZIP)

Ready-to-run unarchived distribution on CD-ROM is also permitted if the 
files are arranged in our standard directory or folder structure as though 
it had been properly installed on a hard disk.

You must distribute a FULL PACKAGE of files as described in the next 
section.  No portion of this package may be separated from the package and 
distributed separately other than under the conditions specified in the 
provisions given below.  

Non-commercial distribution in which no money or compensation is charged 
(such as a user copying the software for a personal friend or colleague) is 
permitted with no other restrictions.  

Teachers and educational institutions may also distribute the material to 
students and may charge minimal copying costs if the software is to be used 
in a course.


                       DEFINITION OF "FULL PACKAGE"

POV-Ray is contained in two sets of archives for each hardware platform.  
A "full package" consists of either:

      1) End user executable archives containing an executable program,
         documentation, and sample scenes but no source.

                                  - or -

      2) Programmer archives containing full source code but no executable.  
         Also you must include an archive containing documentation, and
         sample scenes.  On some platforms, the documentation and sample
         scenes are archived separately from the source.  Source alone
         is not sufficient.  You must have docs and scenes.

POV-Ray is officially distributed for MS-Dos; Windows 32-bit; Linux for 
Intel x86 series; Apple Macintosh; Apple PowerPC; SunOS; and Amiga.  Other 
systems may be added in the future.

Distributors need not support all platforms but for each platform you 
support you must distribute a full package.  For example a Macintosh only 
BBS need not distribute the Windows versions.

This software may ONLY be bundled with other software packages according to 
the conditions specified in the provisions below.


         CONDITIONS FOR SHAREWARE/FREEWARE DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES

Shareware and freeware distribution companies may distribute the software 
included in software-only compilations using media such as, but not limited 
to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, optical disks, hard disks, or memory 
cards.  This section only applies to distributors of collected programs.  
Anyone wishing to bundle the package with a shareware product must use the 
commercial bundling rules.  Any bundling with books, magazines or other 
print media should also use the commercial rules.

You must notify us that you are distributing POV-Ray and must provide us 
with information on how to contact you should any support issues arise. 

No more than five dollars U.S. ($5) can be charged per disk for the copying 
of this software and the media it is provided on. Space on each disk must 
be used as fully as possible.  You may not spread the files over more disks 
than are necessary. 

Distribution on high volume media such as backup tape or CD-ROM is 
permitted if the total cost to the user is no more than $0.08 U.S. dollars 
per megabyte of data.  For example a CD-ROM with 600 meg could cost no more 
than $48.00.


       CONDITIONS FOR ON-LINE SERVICES AND BBS'S INCLUDING INTERNET

On-line services, BBS's and internet sites may distribute the POV-Ray 
software under the conditions in this section.  Sites which allow users to 
run POV-Ray from remote locations must use separate provisions in the 
section below.

The archives must all be easily available on the service and should be 
grouped together in a similar on-line area.  

It is strongly requested that sites remove prior versions of POV-Ray to 
avoid user confusion and simplify or minimize our support efforts.

The site may only charge standard usage rates for the downloading of this 
software. A premium may not be charged for this package. I.E. CompuServe or 
America On-Line may make these archives available to their users, but they 
may only charge regular usage rates for the time required to download. 


                   ONLINE OR REMOTE EXECUTION OF POV-Ray

Some internet sites have been set up so that remote users can actually run 
POV-Ray software on the internet server.  Other companies sell CPU time for 
running POV-Ray software on workstations or high-speed computers.  Such use 
of POV-Ray software is permitted under the following conditions.

Fees or charges, if any, for such services must be for connect time, 
storage or processor usage ONLY.  No premium charges may be assessed for 
use of POV-Ray beyond that charged for use of other software.  Users must 
be clearly notified that they are being charged for use of the computer and 
not for use of POV-Ray software. 

Users must be prominently informed that they are using POV-Ray software, 
that such software is free, and where they can find official POV-Ray 
software.  Any attempt to obscure the fact that the user is running POV-Ray 
is expressly prohibited.  

All files normally available in a full package distribution, especially a 
copy of this license and full documentation must be available for download 
or readable online so that users of an online executable have access to all 
of the material of a full user package.

If the POV-Ray software has been modified in any way, it must also follow 
the provisions for custom versions below.


              CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOM VERSIONS

The user is granted the privilege to modify and compile the source code for 
their own personal use in any fashion they see fit.  What you do with the 
software in your own home is your business.

If the user wishes to distribute a modified version of the software, 
documentation or other parts of the package (here after referred to as a 
"custom version") they must follow the provisions given below.  This 
includes any translation of the documentation into other languages or other 
file formats.  These license provisions have been established to promote 
the growth of POV-Ray and prevent difficulties for users and developers 
alike.  Please follow them carefully for the benefit of all concerned when 
creating a custom version.  

No portion of the POV-Ray source code may be incorporated into another 
program unless it is clearly a custom version of POV-Ray that includes all 
of the basic functions of POV-Ray.  

All executables, documentation, modified files and descriptions of the same 
must clearly identify themselves as a modified and unofficial version of 
POV-Ray.  Any attempt to obscure the fact that the user is running POV-Ray 
or to obscure that this is an unofficial version expressly prohibited.  

You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who use your custom 
version.  You must provide information so that user may contact you for 
support for your custom version.  The POV-Ray Team is not obligated to 
provide you or your users any technical support.

Include contact information in the DISTRIBUTION_MESSAGE macros in the 
source file OPTOUT.H and insure that the program prominently displays this 
information.  Display all copyright notices and credit screens for the 
official version.

Custom versions may only be distributed as freeware.  You must make all of 
your modifications to POV-Ray freely and publicly available with FULL 
SOURCE CODE to the modified portions of POV-Ray and must freely distribute 
full source to any new parts of the custom version.  The goal is that users 
must be able to re-compile the program themselves and to be able to further 
improve the program with their own modifications.

You must provide documentation for any and all modifications that you have 
made to the program that you are distributing.  Include clear and obvious 
information on how to obtain the official POV-Ray.

The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the POV-Ray 
Team, but the team is in no way required to utilize these enhancements 
or fixes.  By sending material to the team, the contributor asserts that 
he owns the materials or has the right to distribute these materials.  
He authorizes the team to use the materials any way they like.  The 
contributor still retains rights to the donated material, but by donating, 
grants unrestricted, irrevocable usage and distribution rights to the 
POV-Ray Team. The team doesn't have to use the material, but if we do, 
you do not acquire any rights related to POV-Ray.  The team will give you 
credit as the creator of new code if applicable.

Include a copy of this document.


                    CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING

Vendors wishing to bundle POV-Ray with commercial software (including 
shareware) or with publications must first obtain explicit permission from 
the POV-Ray Team.  This includes any commercial software or publications, 
such as, but not limited to, magazines, cover-disk distribution, books, 
newspapers, or newsletters in print or machine readable form.

The POV-Ray Team will decide if such distribution will be allowed on a 
case-by-case basis and may impose certain restrictions as it sees fit. 
The minimum terms are given below. Other conditions may be imposed.

      Purchasers of your product must not be led to believe that they are 
paying for POV-Ray.  Any mention of the POV-Ray bundle on the box, in 
advertising or in instruction manuals must be clearly marked with a 
disclaimer that POV-Ray is free software and can be obtained for free or 
nominal cost from various sources.
      Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official 
POV-Ray.
      You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who acquired POV-
Ray through your product.  The POV-Ray Team is not obligated to provide 
you or your customers any technical support.
      Include a credit page or pages in your documentation for POV-Ray.
      If you modify any portion POV-Ray for use with your hardware or 
software, you must follow the custom version rules in addition to these 
rules.
      Include contact and support information for your product.
      Include a full user package as described above.


                       RETAIL VALUE OF THIS SOFTWARE

Although POV-Ray is, when distributed within the terms of this agreement, 
free of charge, the retail value (or price) of this program is determined 
as US$20.00 per copy distributed or copied. If the software is distributed 
or copied without authorization you are legally liable to this debt to the 
copyright holder or any other person or organization delegated by the 
copyright holder for the collection of this debt, and you agree that you 
are legally bound by the above and will pay this debt within 30 days of the 
event.

However, none of the above paragraph constitutes permission for you to 
distribute this software outside of the terms of this agreement. In 
particular, the conditions and debt mentioned above (whether paid or 
unpaid) do not allow you to avoid statutory damages or other legal 
penalties and does not constitute any agreement that would allow you to 
avoid such other legal remedies as are available to the copyright holder.

Put simply, POV-Ray is only free if you comply with our distribution 
conditions; it is not free otherwise. The copyright holder of this software 
chooses to give it away free under these and only these conditions.

For the purpose of copyright regulations, the retail value of this software 
is US$20.00 per copy.


                             OTHER PROVISIONS

The team permits and encourages the creation of programs, including 
commercial packages, which import, export or translate files in the POV-Ray 
Scene Description Language.  There are no restrictions on use of the 
language itself.  We reserve the right to add or remove or change any part 
of the language.

"POV-Ray", "Persistence of Vision", "POV-Ray Team" and "POV-Help" are 
trademarks of the POV-Ray Team.  

While we do not claim any restrictions on the letters "POV" alone, we 
humbly request that you not use POV in the name of your product.  Such use 
tends to imply it is a product of the POV-Ray Team.  Existing programs 
which used "POV" prior to the publication of this document need 
not feel guilty for doing so provided that you make it clear that the 
program is not the work of the team nor endorsed by us.


                           REVOCATION OF LICENSE

VIOLATION OF THIS LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT LAWS.  IT WILL RESULT 
IN REVOCATION OF ALL DISTRIBUTION PRIVILEGES AND MAY RESULT IN CIVIL OR 
CRIMINAL PENALTY.  

Such violators who are prohibited from distribution will be identified in 
this document.

In this regard, "PC Format", a magazine published by Future Publishing, 
Ltd. in the United Kingdom, distributed incomplete versions of POV-Ray 1.0 
in violation the license which was effect at the time.  They later 
attempted to distribute POV-Ray 2.2 without prior permission of the POV-Ray 
Team in violation the license which was in effect at the time.  There
is evidence that other Future Publishing companies have also violated
our terms.  Therefore "PC Format", and any other magazine, book or CD-ROM
publication owned by Future Publishing is expressly prohibited from any
distribution of POV-Ray software until further notice.
