                        Known Bug Information
                  -------------------------------

The only verified bug that we have found but not fixed in POV-Ray 2.2
is that you may not nest a tiles texture within a tiles texture.
The POV-Ray Team is working on the problem but decided to not delay 
this release further.  See WHATSNEW.DOC for the bugs we did fix.
