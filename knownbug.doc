                        Known Bug Information
                  -------------------------------

The only verified bug that we have found but not fixed in POV-Ray 2.1
is a problem with height fields which causes holes, missing sections
or cracks.  The POV-Ray Team is working on the problem but decided to
not delay this release further.  See WHATSNEW.DOC for the bugs we did
fix.

If you have problems with height fields and are able to re-compile
the source code, the following changes work around the problem but
it defeats much of the height field optimization and slows things
appreciably.

In HFIELD.C at lines 254-259 and 407-412 you should comment-out the
lines....


  if(min_value(start->y,end->y) > (DBL)Block->max_y)
    return(FALSE);

  if(max_value(start->y,end->y) < (DBL)Block->min_y)
    return(FALSE);

Of course if you remove these lines, the height fields render more slowly.
It appears that the min/max values for the "blocks" are being calculated
incorrectly at times. 

When a better fix is available we will release it.
