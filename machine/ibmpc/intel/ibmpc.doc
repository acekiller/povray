This file contains the documentation specific to the IBM-PC version of
POV-Ray. See POVRAY.DOC for general program info.

  The executable POVRAY.EXE was compiled using the Intel Code Builder   
32 bit protected mode compiler. A 386 or 486 and at least 2 meg of RAM
are required to run this program. See IBMPCEXE.DOC for more info.

Running POV-Ray:
   POV-Ray is run from the DOS command line by typing the program name,
   povray.exe. Command line options are 

   
Display Options:
+d   = Alone, will autodetect the display type and display the image 
       to the screen as it's being worked on. Try specifying the display
       type explicitly if autodetect doesn't work. +d? will invoke a
       message to report what display POV-Ray is detecting.

-v   =  Usually, you should use -v in conjunction with +d. This 
        will turn off the line number text display. It will work
        with some display options. You can experiment to see which.

+d#p = The first character after d is the display type, resolution is 
       automatically selected. The second character is the palette type
       or color selection method.

Some Examples
--------------
+d0h = Autodetect the VGA display type
       and display the image to the screen
       as it's being worked on.
       Use the Sierra HiColor chip and
       dithering to display more than 32,000
       colors on screen. Looks great!
+d1  = Display to standard VGA screen 320x200.
       Try this if your SVGA display is not supported.
       Use this option to get a scaled image in a window
       on the OS/2 2.x desktop.
+dG0 = Display to a VESA VGA adapter and
       use the HSV palette option.
+dG3 = Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use 
       the 332 palette option.
+dGH = Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use 
       the HiColor option for 32,768 colors.
+dGT = Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use
       the TrueColor option for over 16 
       million colors.

( Note that your VESA BIOS *MUST* support these options in order  )
( for you to use them!! Some cards may support HiColor &/or       )
( TrueColor at the hardware level but *not* thru their VESA BIOS. )

+d4  = Display to a TSENG 4000 chipset VGA using
       the 332 palette option.

If your card isn't autodetected correctly try all the options. 
If no option works, just use +d1 for standard VGA.

    +dF     Trident SVGA 640x480
    +dG     VESA Standard SVGA Adapter
    +dH     ATI XL display card
    +dI     Diamond Computer Systems SpeedSTAR 24X
            (Note: The SpeedSTAR 24X will -not- be autodetected with the +d0 )
            (      option.                                                   )

PALETTE OPTIONS:
    +d?3 Use 332 palette with dithering 
          (Default and best for VGA systems)

    +d?h Use HiColor option. 
          Displays 32,000+ colors with dithering. 
          Supported on VESA, SpeedSTAR 24X, 
          ATI XL HiColor and Tseng 4000 based cards 
          with Sierra & Sierra compatible Cirrus DAC's 
          only. Looks great!

    +d?0 Use HSV palette option for VGA display

    +d?G Use Grayscale palette option for VGA display

    +d?T For Truecolor 24 bit cards. Use 24 bit color.
          Supported on the Diamond SpeedSTAR 24X and
          cards with 24bit VESA support only.


File Formats:
   The default file format for the IBM-PC is Targa (+ft). This format 
is a 24 bit color image allowing over 16 million colors to be created.
Most IBM-PC systems do not have the capability to directly display
Targa images. They must be converted to 256 color GIF images so they
can be viewed on a VGA or SVGA display. To convert a TGA file to a GIF
file, get a copy of  PICLAB or Image Alchemy which can be found on 
Compuserve, America On-Line, and many BBS's. The program documentation
will describe how to convert a TGA to a GIF.

  Also, many SVGA cards now have a Sierra HiColor DAC for 15/16 bit color.
Get a copy of the program TGVIEW and you can see your rendered images
in "almost" full color.
