This file contains the documentation specific to the VMS version of POV-Ray.

Note: PLEASE SEE POVLEGAL.DOC.  The VMS version in ZIP format is an
   officially supported format and can be distributed as is.  You MAY NOT
   re-package the archive file or distribute any changes to it.  If you
   do post it on a BBS or network, you must provide at least the data
   files and documentation files with the executables.  See POVLEGAL.DOC
   for complete details.

Testing:
   This version of POV-Ray for the VAX may only have been tested on an
   Alpha AXP 500 running OpenVMS 1.5. It may need tweaking for your compiler.

Executables:
   At this stage, no executables are provided.

** ALPHA USERS ***
   Please ensure you #define ALPHA in vaxconf.h (config.h).
   This will avoid a whole heap of warnings when you compile.

** Known Bug on ALPHA **
   When you use the +B option to set a buffer > 64kB on the DEC Alpha running
   OpenVMS 1.5, the program will halt when 65kB of data has been buffered.
   This seems to be a problem with either DEC's implementation of setvbuf ()
   or the file buffering associated with file output.
   Solution : keep the bufer size < 65kB.

Running POV-Ray:
   Assign a foreign symbol to the executable. The syntax is:
      povray :== $<your_disk>:[<directory>]povray
   An example symbol might look like:
      povray :== $dua100:[povray.build]povray
   or
      povray :== $dua100:[povray.build]povray +w320 +h200 +d +v [for example]

   You may also like to add your include file path to the symbol.
   When running POV-Ray, be sure that you have a large working set.
   You will need to use the '+d' option for the X version to display anything.

File Formats:
   The default file format for the Vax is "targa" format (+ft).
   Dump or raw may be specified on the command line or in the
   povray.def file. The TGA2GIF program (not included in this archive)
   may be used to convert the output to a GIF file.

Building the source:
   To compile POV-Ray from the original source, follow the following instructions:
   You will of course need a properly set up C compiler.

   If you want to use the X version you will need X and the X libraries.
   You may need to edit the POVRAY.OPT file for your X library path.
   Motif is NOT needed, as POV runs with X and Xt only.

   #define X_GETS_ARGS in vaxconf.h if you want to use X options such as
   '-display xxx:n.n'. Note that some may conflict with POV options.

     1) create a [.source] directory.

     2) copy the files from POVSRC.ZIP's SOURCE directory into this directory.

     3) copy the files from POVSRC.ZIP's MACHINE\VAX directory into [.source].

     4) rename vaxconf.h to config.h

     5) execute "@vaxbuild" for a NON XWindows executable.

     6) execute "@xvaxbld" for an XWindows executable.

   Note that if you switch between X and non-X versions you MUST recompile
   ALL FILES.

Post-processing Images:
   POV-Ray images can be post-processed using the PBMPLUS utilities.
   The program TGA2GIF (source available on Compuserve in GRAPHDEV section 8
   as TGAGI2.ZIP) will run on a VAX and does a nice job of converting Targa
   output files into GIF files.

Displaying Images:
   There are various programs around that can display GIF files under X
   windows. At a later stage I may upload one into GRAPHDEV, so have a look.
   Some DECwindows systems come with a program called PICT.EXE, which will do a
   good job of displaying GIF files, also.

   For those with a Postscipt printer, you can use PBMPLUS to convert POV-Ray
   files to Postscript and then print them.

The VMS X Windows code was developed and tested by Christopher J. Cason under
DECWindows on a DEC Alpha AXP 500 running OpenVMS 1.5.

Questions and problems in the VAX/VMS version can be directed to Chris Cason on
Compuserve via mail or in the POV source section of GRAPHDEV. (currently 8).

I will continue to enhance this code and test it other machines.
If you had to make any modifications to get it to compile, please let me know
so that I may update this source accordingly. This particularly applies to
the build files. By doing so, you will be helping others.

If you have any problems getting it to build, you may like to contact me or
check the POV section of GRAPHDEV on Compuserve to see if there are updated
files. Try scanning for the keyword VMS or XWINDOWS.
