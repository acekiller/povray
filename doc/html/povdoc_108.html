<h3>3.9.11&nbsp;&nbsp;When All Else Fails: Material Maps</h3>
<a name="target_218"></a>

  <p>We have some pretty powerful texturing tools at our disposal, but what if
  we want a more free form arrangement of complex textures? Well, just as image
  maps do for pigments, and bump maps do for normals, whole textures can be
  mapped using a material map, should the need arise.</p><p>
   Just as with image maps and bump maps, we need a source image in bitmapped
  format which will be called by POV-Ray to serve as the map of where the
  individual textures will go, but this time, we need to specify what texture
  will be associated with which palette index. To make such an image, we can
  use a paint program which allows us to select colors by their palette index
  number (the actual color is irrelevant, since it is only a map to tell
  POV-Ray what texture will go at that location). Now, if we have the complete
  package that comes with POV-Ray, we have in our include files an image called
  <code>povmap.gif</code> which is a bitmapped image that uses only the first
  four palette indices to create a bordered square with the words
  &quot;Persistence of Vision&quot; in it. This will do just fine as a sample
  map for the following example. Using our same include files, the camera and
  light source, we enter the following object.</p>
<pre>
  plane {
    -z, 0
    texture {
      material_map {
        gif &quot;povmap.gif&quot;
        interpolate 2
        once
        texture { PinkAlabaster }          // the inner border
        texture { pigment { DMFDarkOak } } // outer border
        texture { Gold_Metal }             // lettering
        texture { Chrome_Metal }           // the window panel
      }
      translate &lt;-0.5, -0.5, 0&gt;
      scale 5
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>The position of the light source and the lack of foreground objects to be
  reflected do not show these textures off to their best advantage. But at
  least we can see how the process works. The textures have simply been placed
  according to the location of pixels of a particular palette index. By using
  the <code><a href="povdoc_217.html#target_1180">once</a></code> keyword (to keep it from tiling), and translating and
  scaling our map to match the camera we have been using, we get to see the
  whole thing laid out for us.</p><p>
   Of course, that is just with palette mapped image formats, such as GIF and
  certain flavors of PNG. Material maps can also use non-paletted formats, such
  as the TGA files that POV-Ray itself outputs. That leads to an interesting
  consequence: We can use POV-Ray to produce source maps for POV-Ray! Before we
  wrap up with some of the limitations of special textures, let's do one
  more thing with material maps, to show how POV-Ray can make its own source
  maps.</p><p>
   To begin with, if using a non-paletted image, POV-Ray looks at the 8 bit
  red component of the pixel's color (which will be a value from 0 to 255)
  to determine which texture from the list to use. So to create a source map,
  we need to control very precisely what the red value of a given pixel will
  be. We can do this by</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Using an rgb statement to choose our color such as rgb &lt;N/255,0,0&gt;,
      where &quot;N&quot; is the red value we want to assign that pigment, and then...</li>
  <li>Use no light sources and apply a finish of <code>finish { ambient 1 }</code>
      to all objects, to ensure that highlighting and shadowing will not interfere.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Confused? Alright, here is an example, which will generate a map very much
  like <code>povmap.gif</code> which we used earlier, except in TGA file
  format. We notice that we have given the pigments blue and green components
  too. POV-Ray will ignore that in our final map, so this is really for us
  humans, whose unaided eyes cannot tell the difference between red variances
  of 0 to 4/255ths. Without those blue and green variances, our map would look
  to our eyes like a solid black screen. That may be a great way to send secret
  messages using POV-Ray (plug it into a material map to decode) but it is no
  use if we want to see what our source map looks like to make sure we have
  what we expected to.</p><p>
   We create the following code, name it <code>povmap.pov</code>, then render
  it. This will create an output file called <code>povmap.tga</code> (<b><code>povmap.bmp</code>
  on Windows systems</b>).</p>
<pre>
  camera {
    orthographic
    up &lt;0, 5, 0&gt;
    right &lt;5, 0, 0&gt;
    location &lt;0, 0, -25&gt;
    look_at &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
  }
  plane {
    -z, 0
    pigment { rgb &lt;1/255, 0, 0.5&gt; }
    finish { ambient 1 }
  }
  box {
    &lt;-2.3, -1.8, -0.2&gt;, &lt;2.3, 1.8, -0.2&gt;
    pigment { rgb &lt;0/255, 0, 1&gt; }
    finish { ambient 1 }
  }
  box {
    &lt;-1.95, -1.3, -0.4&gt;, &lt;1.95, 1.3, -0.3&gt;
    pigment { rgb &lt;2/255, 0.5, 0.5&gt; }
    finish { ambient 1 }
  }
  text {
    ttf &quot;crystal.ttf&quot;, &quot;The vision&quot;, 0.1, 0
    scale &lt;0.7, 1, 1&gt;
    translate &lt;-1.8, 0.25, -0.5&gt;
    pigment { rgb &lt;3/255, 1, 1&gt; }
    finish { ambient 1 }
  }
  text {
    ttf &quot;crystal.ttf&quot;, &quot;Persists!&quot;, 0.1, 0
    scale &lt;0.7, 1, 1&gt;
    translate &lt;-1.5, -1, -0.5&gt;
    pigment { rgb &lt;3/255, 1, 1&gt; }
    finish { ambient 1 }
  }
</pre>

  <p>All we have to do is modify our last material map example by changing the
  material map from GIF to TGA and modifying the filename. When we render using
  the new map, the result is extremely similar to the palette mapped GIF we
  used before, except that we didn't have to use an external paint program
  to generate our source: POV-Ray did it all!</p>
