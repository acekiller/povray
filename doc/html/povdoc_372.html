<h3>9.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I make a while-loop?</h3>

<p>It depends on what you are trying to make.

</p><p>The most common usage is to use it as a simple for-loop, that is, a loop
which loops a certain number of times (for example 10 times) with an index
value getting successive values (for example 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

</p><p>For this you need to first declare your index identifier with the first
value. For example:

<pre>
#declare Index = 1;
</pre>

</p><p>Now you want to loop 10 times. Remember how the condition worked: The
while-loop loops as long as the condition is true. So it should loop as long
as our 'Index' identifier is less or equal to 10:

<pre>
#while(Index &lt;= 10)
</pre>

</p><p>When the 'Index' gets the value 11 the loop ends, as it should.

</p><p>Now we only have to add 1 to 'Index' at each loop, so we should do it
at the end of the loop, thus getting:

<pre>
#declare Index = 1;
#while(Index &lt;= 10)

  (some commands here)

  #declare Index = Index + 1;
#end
</pre>

</p><p>The incrementation before the #end is important. If we don't do it, 'Index'
would always have the value 1 and the loop would go forever since 1 is always
less or equal to 10.

</p><p>What happens here?

<ol>
 <li>First POV-Ray sets the value 1 to 'Index'.</li>
 <li>Then it sees the #while statement and evaluates what is between the
     parentheses: Index &lt;= 10</li>
 <li>As 'Index' has the value of 1 and 1 &lt;= 10, the condition evaluates to
     true.</li>
 <li>So, it just continues normally. It executes the commands following
     the #while statement (denoted in the above example as
     &quot;(some commands here)&quot;).</li>
 <li>Then it arrives normally to the last #declare command in the block.
     This causes the value 2 to be assigned to 'Index'.</li>
 <li>Now it arrives the the #end command and so it just jumps to the #while.</li>
 <li>After that it executes the steps 2-6 again because also 2 is less or
     equal to 10.</li>
 <li>After this has been done 10 times, the value 11 is assigned to 'Index'
     in the last command of the block.</li>
 <li>Now, when POV-Ray evaluates the condition it sees that it's false
     (because 11 is not less or equal to 10). This causes POV-Ray to jump
     to the command after the #end statement.</li>
 <li>The net effect of all this is that POV-Ray looped 10 times and the
     'Index' variable got successive values from 1 to 10 along the way.</li>
</ol>

</p><p>If you read carefully the above description you'll notice that the
looping is done in a quite &quot;dumb&quot; way, that is, there's no higher logic
hidden inside the loop structure. In fact, POV-Ray doesn't have the slightest
idea how many times the loop is executed and what variable is used to
count the loops. It just follows orders.

</p><p>The higher logic in this type of loop is in the combination of commands
we wrote. The effect of this combination is that the loop works like a
simple for-loop in most programming languages (like BASIC, etc).</p>
