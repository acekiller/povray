<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>
This document pertains to the use and distribution of the Persistence of Vision&trade; Ray Tracer a.k.a 
POV-Ray&trade; and known in this document as POV-Ray&trade; or 'the Software'. It applies to all POV-
Ray&trade; program source files, executable (binary) files, scene files, documentation files, help file, 
bitmaps and INI files contained in official POV-Team&trade; archives.   All of these are referred to here 
as &quot;the Software&quot;. The POV-Team&trade; reserves the right to revise these rules in future versions and 
to make additional rules to address new circumstances at any time. Such rules, when made, will 
be posted in a revised POVLEGAL.DOC, the latest version of which is available from our website 
at <a href="http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html" target="new">http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html</a>.
The POV-Team&trade; are the programmers and assistants from time to time who work as part of the &quot;POV-Team&quot;
in the development, modification and/or distribution of the Software.

<h4>INTENT OF THIS LICENSE</h4>

<p>
The intent of this license is to allow the free and legal distribution of POV-Ray&trade; throughout the 
community, and to permit users to freely enjoy its benefits. The POV-Ray&trade; developers, past and 
present, have donated their time and in some cases considerable amounts of their own money 
towards the development of this software package, which we provide for no charge (within the 
constraints of this license) to the public at large. 

<p>
The POV-Ray&trade; developers decided, long ago (about 1990), that they did not want the free nature 
of this package to be sullied by unscrupulous third parties who wanted to make a quick buck from 
the developer's hard work. This decision was made after some practical experience with just such 
activity. We have strong objections to end-users having to pay for this software when they could 
have received it for free had they only known better. 

<p>
Though this may seem an unlikely scenario for those used to the internet and aware of the free 
availability of POV-Ray&trade;, this in fact does to this day still happen. As this updated POVLEGAL is 
being written (in 2001) there is at least one CD that we know of - being sold both on the internet 
and in stores - that is presented to potential purchasers as a 3D rendering product, with nothing 
present on the exterior that would lead the buyer to believe that the renderer inside is in fact a free 
program (namely, POV-Ray&trade;). 

<p>
Therefore, the intent of this license is to encourage free distribution and use, while severely 
restricting non-free distribution and use. Some of the more wordy sections below dealing with 
third-party distribution have only become so because some commercial vendors found some fairly 
imaginative ways to avoid the intent of this license. If your intended use of the Software seems to 
conflict with this basic intent, you should contact us before proceeding with your plans (but read 
the rest of this document before you write). 

<h4>WHY ISN'T POV-RAY OPEN SOURCE ?</h4>

<p>
While this explanation doesn't really belong in this document, we are asked it often enough that we 
have decided to put it here. While the POV-Ray&trade; source code is freely available, it isn't 'open' 
according to the currently popular definition of the term (meaning that it isn't available to create 
derivative works). The reasons for this are historical. Primarily, at the time that POV-Ray&trade; was 
originally developed (starting in about 1990), on Compuserve, it was a different environment than 
today. Virtually none of the developers had internet access and there wasn't a great awareness of 
things like the GPL. The team at that time rolled their own license - one that allowed free use of 
the software but attempted to prevent people taking unfair advantage of it. 

<p>
As people contributed code to POV-Ray&trade; over the years - and there have been many instances 
of this - they contributed it to us on the understanding that it would be covered by the POV-Ray&trade; 
license, as it stood at the time. Now, in 2001, we find that in many cases we don't know who wrote 
what part of the code, or that the author is uncontactable. We simply don't have the right to 
arbitrarily change the terms under which their source code is distributed. Even though it was 
contributed to us, we feel that we must honor the terms under which it was given. Therefore, POV-
Ray&trade; will remain on this existing license until we do a full re-write (which is intended for v4), at 
which time a new license will be instituted that is far more liberal in terms of reuse. 

<h4>COPYRIGHT</h4>

<p>
Copyright &copy;, POV-Team&trade; 1991-2002.  Copyright subsists in the Software which is protected by 
Australian and international copyright laws.   Although it is distributed as freeware, it is NOT 
PUBLIC DOMAIN.  You acknowledge that any and all intellectual property rights including all rights 
of copyright used or embodied in or in connection with the Software are and will remain the sole 
property of the POV-Team&trade;.  You shall not question or dispute the ownership of such rights at 
any time.  Nothing in this document shall give you any rights in respect of the intellectual property 
of the POV-Team&trade; and you acknowledge that you do not acquire any rights in respect of such 
intellectual property rights.  If you use, modify or distribute the Software for unauthorized purposes 
or in an unauthorized manner, you will be liable to the POV-Team&trade; for any damages it may suffer 
(and which you acknowledge it may suffer) and you may also be liable to criminal prosecution.  
You indemnify the POV-Team&trade; for every single consequence flowing from your unauthorized use 
of the Software.

<h4>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h4>

<p>
This Software is provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis, without warranty of any kind, express or implied,  
including without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular 
purpose and non-infringement of intellectual property of any third party. This Software has inherent 
limitations including design faults and programming bugs.   As the program is free, the entire risk 
as to the quality and performance of the Software is borne by you, and it is your responsibility to 
ensure that it does what you intend it to do prior to using it for any purpose other than testing it. 
Should the Software prove defective, you and not the POV-Team&trade; or anyone associated with 
them assume the entire cost of any service and repair. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an 
essential and material term of this agreement. 

<h4>NO LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY</h4>

<p>
When you use the Software you acknowledge and accept that you do so at your sole risk.  You 
agree that under no circumstances shall you have any claim against  the POV-Team&trade; or anyone 
associated directly or indirectly with the POV-Team&trade; whether as employee, subcontractor, agent, 
representative, consultant, licensee or otherwise (&quot;POV-Team&trade; associates&quot;) for any loss, 
damages, harm, injury, expense, work stoppage, loss of business information, business 
interruption, computer failure or malfunction which may be suffered by you or by any third party 
from any cause whatsoever, howsoever arising, in connection with your use and/or distribution of 
the Software even where the POV-Team&trade; were aware, or ought to have been aware, of the 
potential of such loss.  Damages shall include direct, indirect, general, special, incidental, punitive 
and/or consequential.  If you do not accept this no liability condition, you must not use this 
Software.   

<p>
You indemnify the POV-Team&trade; and the POV-Team&trade; associates and hold them harmless against 
any claims which may arise from any loss, damages, harm, injury, expense, work stoppage, loss 
of business information, business interruption, computer failure or malfunction, which may be 
suffered by you, your spouse, dependants or any other third party whatsoever as a consequence 
of any act or omission of the POV-Team&trade;  and/or the POV-Team&trade; associates, whether negligent 
or not, arising out of your use and/or distribution of the Software, or from any other cause 
whatsoever, howsoever arising in connection with the Software.  These provisions are binding on 
your estate, heirs, executors, administrators, parents and/or guardians.    

<h4>HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES</h4>

<p>
This Software and the output produced by this Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, 
manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous 
environments requiring fail-safe performance, in which the failure of the Software could lead 
directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (&quot;High Risk 
Activities&quot;). The POV-Team specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for 
High Risk Activities. 

<h4>USAGE PROVISIONS</h4>

<p>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, permission is granted to the user to use the 
Software and associated files in this package to create and render images. The use of this 
Software for the purpose of creating images is completely free. The creator of a scene file retains 
all rights to the scene file they created, and any image generated by the Software from them. 

<p>
The user is also granted the right to use the scene files, fonts, bitmaps, and include files 
distributed in the INCLUDE and SCENES\INCDEMO sub-directories in their own scenes. Such 
permission does not extend to any other files in the SCENES directory or its sub-directories. The 
SCENES files are for your enjoyment and education but may not be the basis of any derivative 
works unless the file in question explicitly grants permission to do such.

<h4>ACCEPTANCE OF LICENSE</h4>

<p>
Some jurisdictions deem licenses that have not been physically signed by the person or legal entity
using the software which is the subject of the license to have not been accepted in a legal sense.
However, since you have not paid for this Software, nothing else other than acceptance of this
license in full grants you the right to use, modify, or distribute it or any derivative works made
from it. By using, modifying, making a derivative work, or distributing any part or version of the
Software, you indicate your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If you
have not accepted the license such actions would be illegal.

<h4>DISTRIBUTION AND/OR MODIFICATION</h4>

<p>
This copyrighted package may ONLY be distributed and/or modified according to the terms and 
conditions contained in this License Agreement.  

<p>
The permission to distribute this Software, under certain very specific conditions, is granted in 
advance, provided that the following conditions are met. If your distribution, or intended 
distribution, does not meet these conditions, you may not distribute the Software. 

<p>
Anyone intending to distribute this Software must ensure that they comply with our license at all 
times. If you are intending to distribute POV-Ray&trade; and are not reading the master copy of this 
license found on our web site at <a href="http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html" target="new">http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html</a>,
you should instead read that version, as it may have changed since the copy that you are reading was written.  

<p>
The Software must not be distributed commercially (where 'commercially' means any distribution that
would qualify under the terms of the 'CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING' section which appears later
in this document) without the express written permission of the POV-Team. This restriction applies
not only to this Software but also to any derivative of it or any part of it.

<p>
You may not distribute (or continue to distribute if you have already started) the Software if you 
have been or are in breach of any of the conditions of this license, or if you or your legal 
representatives have been notified by us or our authorized representatives (via telephone, email, 
fax, or physical mail to the last known contact point for that communication method) that you may 
not. 

<p>
The Software must not be distributed in a form different from the official distribution  without the 
express, prior, written permission of the POV-Team&trade;. The official distribution are those official 
versions which appear on our website from time to time.  You may rename the distribution files 
only to meet the file name conventions of your system or to avoid file name duplications. The 
POV-Team&trade; is willing to make exceptions in certain circumstances (e.g. to allow Linux vendors to 
use RPM), but these are on a case-by-case basis. Please write us if you would like to do this. 

<p>
You must distribute a FULL PACKAGE of files as defined under &quot;DEFINITION OF FULL 
PACKAGE&quot; below, in the next section. No portion of this package may be separated from the 
package and distributed separately other than under the conditions specified in the provisions 
given below. 

<p>
Any physical distribution (that is, by any means other than online download) of POV-Ray&trade; by any 
person or organisation, for any purpose other than personal sharing of the software, must include 
full contact details of the distributor. This includes at the very least a valid physical mailing address 
(including country), a telephone number if the distributor provides that for any of its other products, 
and a working, manned email address if the distributor has an internet presence of any sort. If the 
distributor has a web site then its URL must also be included. 

<p>
Only non-commercial distribution in which no money or compensation is charged (such as a user 
copying the Software for a personal friend or colleague) is permitted.  No other restrictions may be 
placed on the distribution of the Software.  

<p>
Internet distribution of our official archives on web or FTP sites is permitted, provided that no 
charge is made for downloading or accessing the files (other than the normal fees the user pays to 
access the internet), and that the versions distributed are the latest available (or that, in the case 
of a web page, a clearly positioned link is provided to the latest version, and in the case of an FTP 
site, that the latest version is present in the same subdirectory). 

<p>
Teachers and educational institutions may also distribute the material to students for free or they 
may charge minimal copying costs if the Software is to be used in a course. 

<p>
Any other distribution for which money or any other compensation is asked for or received must 
meet the terms and conditions set out below. 

<h4>CONDITIONS FOR CD-ROM DISTRIBUTION<br>
CONDITIONS FOR SHAREWARE/FREEWARE DISTRIBUTION</h4>

<p>
A 'shareware and freeware distributor', for the purpose of this document, is one which CLEARLY 
IDENTIFIES itself as such to anyone dealing with it or its resellers, both in general, and also with 
respect to the interior and exterior packaging of any products it sells. If there is any possibility that 
a person, prior to or after performing a purchase of any shareware or freeware product from the 
distributor or any reseller of the distributor, would not be aware that they are receiving shareware 
or freeware software, then that distributor is NOT considered a 'shareware or freeware distributor' 
by this license, and the following grant of permission does not apply to them. 

<p>
Additionally, the following only applies to distributors of collected programs; anyone wishing to 
bundle the package with a shareware product must use the commercial bundling rules set out 
below under &quot;CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING&quot;. Also, a distribution that would 
otherwise have qualified under the 'shareware/freeware distributor' terms, but which is constructed 
in such a way that it would be of little or no practical use without POV-Ray&trade;, is considered 
commercial and must use the commercial bundling rules. 

<p>
Shareware and freeware distribution companies may distribute the Software included in software-
only compilations using media such as, but not limited to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, 
optical disks, hard disks, or memory cards. 

<p>
Distribution on CD-ROM or high capacity media such as backup tape is permitted if the total cost 
to the user is no more than two (2) U.S. cents per megabyte of data. For example a CD-ROM with 
600 meg could cost no more than US$12.00 at any point of sale, including the point of sale to the 
consumer. Companies or individuals that distribute to resellers hereby agree that they will be in 
breach of this license if any of their resellers breach this license and such companies or individuals 
indemnify the POV-Team&trade; accordingly. 

<p>
Any bundling with books, magazines or other print media must have the prior written approval of 
the POV-Team&trade;. If we do approve of such publication, you must provide us with two (2) copies of 
the publication in question as soon as it is released. In the case of magazines, we normally 
approve such requests, subject to the conditions in this document. 

<p>
For floppy disk distribution, no more than one US dollar (US$1.00) can be charged per disk for the 
copying of this Software and the media it is provided on. Space on each disk must be used as fully 
as possible. You may not spread the files over more disks than are necessary. 

<p>
The users to whom you wish to distribute the Software must also agree to be bound by the terms 
and conditions of this License Agreement.  You indemnify the POV-Team&trade; from any loss or harm 
which it may suffer as a result of your failure to ensure that the users to whom you are distributing 
the Software have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

ONLINE OR REMOTE EXECUTION OF POV-RAY

Some internet sites have been set up so that remote users can actually run POV-Ray&trade; software 
on the internet server.  Other companies sell CPU time for running POV-Ray&trade; software on 
workstations or high-speed computers. Such use of POV-Ray&trade; software is permitted under the 
following conditions. 

<p>
Fees or charges, if any, for such services must be for connect time, storage or processor usage 
ONLY. No premium charges may be assessed for use of POV-Ray&trade; beyond that charged for use 
of other software. Users must be clearly notified that they are being charged for use of the 
computer and not for use of POV-Ray&trade; software. 

<p>
Users must be prominently informed that they are using POV-Ray&trade; software, that such software 
is free, and where they can find official POV-Ray&trade; software. Any attempt to obscure the fact that 
the user is running POV-Ray&trade; is expressly prohibited. 

<p>
All files normally available in a full package distribution, especially a copy of this license and full 
documentation must be available for download or readable online so that users of an online 
executable have access to all of the material of a full user package. The full user package is the 
entire distribution for a given platform excluding the actual program files. The distributor must also 
ensure that the users have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license, failing 
which such users may not download or view or use the Software.

<p>
If the POV-Ray&trade; software has been modified in any way, it must also comply with the provisions 
for custom versions set out under &quot;CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOM VERSIONS&quot; 
below. 

<h4>DEFINITION OF &quot;FULL PACKAGE&quot;</h4>

<p>
A &quot;full package&quot; contains an executable program, documentation, and sample scenes. For generic 
Unix platforms, there are no executables available so the source code must be included instead of 
the executable program, unless you choose to build one (in which case you must comply with the 
terms for unofficial versions, found below). 

<p>
POV-Ray&trade; is officially distributed for Windows 95/98/NT; Linux for Intel x86 series; and Apple 
PowerPC. Other systems may be added in the future. 

<p>
Distributors need not support all platforms but for each platform you support you must distribute a 
full package. For example a Macintosh only CD-ROM need not distribute the Windows versions. 

<p>
This Software may ONLY be bundled with other software packages according to the conditions 
specified under &quot;CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING&quot; below. 

<h4>PERMITTED MODIFICATION AND CUSTOM VERSIONS</h4>

<p>
Although the full source code for POV-Ray&trade; is distributed, there are strict rules for the use of the 
source code. The source distribution is provided to; 1) promote the porting of POV-Ray&trade; to 
hardware and operating systems which the POV-Team&trade; cannot support, 2) promote 
experimentation and development of new features to the core code which might eventually be 
incorporated into the official version, and 3) provide insight into the inner workings of the program 
for educational purposes. 

<p>
These license provisions have been established to promote the growth of POV-Ray&trade; and prevent 
difficulties for users and developers alike. Please follow them carefully for the benefit of all 
concerned when creating a custom version. 

<p>
The user is granted the privilege to modify and compile the source code for their own personal use 
in any fashion they see fit. 

<p>
However strict conditions and restrictions are imposed if the user wishes to distribute a modified 
version of the Software, documentation or other parts of the package (hereafter referred to as a 
&quot;custom version&quot;). This includes any translation of the documentation into other languages or other 
file formats. 

<p>
A &quot;custom version&quot; is defined as a fully functional version of POV-Ray&trade; with all existing features, 
copyright notices, author attributions, this License Agreement, etc., intact. ANY OTHER USE OF 
ANY POV-RAY SOURCE CODE IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED. The POV-Team&trade; does not 
license source code for any use outside POV-Ray&trade;. No portion of the POV-Ray&trade; source code 
may be, under any circumstances, incorporated into another program unless it is clearly a custom 
version of POV-Ray&trade; that includes all of the functions of the POV-Ray&trade; renderer. 

<p>
All executables, documentation, modified files and descriptions of the same must clearly identify 
themselves as a modified and unofficial version of POV-Ray&trade;. Any attempt to obscure the fact 
that the user is running POV-Ray&trade; or to obscure that it is an unofficial version is expressly 
prohibited. 

<p>
POV-Ray&trade; may not be linked into other software either at compile-time using an object code 
linker nor at run-time as a DLL, ActiveX, or other system. Such linkage can tend to blur the end-
user's perception of which program provides which functions and thus qualifies as an attempt to 
obscure what is running. 

<p>
To allow POV-Ray&trade; to communicate with outside programs, the official versions of POV-Ray&trade; 
may include internal communication &quot;hooks&quot; for it to call other tasks, often called an Application 
Programming Interface, or API. For example: the generic part of POV-Ray&trade; provides operating 
system shell-out API commands. The Windows version has a GUI-extension API and the ability to 
replace the text editor. Modification to these APIs or other officially supported communication 
mechanisms to increase functionality beyond that of the official version, or to avoid the intent of 
this license, is EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED. 

<h4>CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOM VERSIONS</h4>

<p>
If your re-compiled version meets all requirements for custom versions listed above under 
&quot;PERMITTED MODIFICATION AND CUSTOM VERSIONS&quot;, the following additional conditions apply to its 
distribution: 

<p>
You must provide all support for all users who use your custom version. You must provide 
information so that users may contact you for support for your custom version. The POV-Ray&trade; 
Team is not obligated to provide you or your users any technical support. 

<p>
You must include contact information in the DISTRIBUTION_MESSAGE macros in the source file 
OPTOUT.H and insure that the program prominently displays this information. You must ensure 
that your version displays all copyright notices and credit screens for the official version, though 
they must be clearly marked as unofficial.   

<p>
The purpose of this next requirement is to allow the official POV-Ray&trade; to detect scene files that 
are incompatible with it by testing the #version declaration. It can then tell the user why the given 
scene file will not work, rather than issue what could be confusing syntax errors or perform 
erroneous rendering. This results in a better experience for the end users of this Software. 

<p>
If your custom version contains any feature that would cause a POV-Ray&trade; scene source file that 
works on your version to fail or otherwise work incorrectly on either the current official version of 
POV-Ray&trade;, or on the official version that was built from the version of the source that you are 
using for your custom version, you must include code that checks that the scene source file has a 
#version directive that includes the 'unofficial' token, and you must only activate your changes 
(including, but not limited to, new keywords) if that #version directive is present. If it is not present 
your custom version must work in the same way as the standard POV-Ray&trade; that it is built from. 
An example of a correct 'unofficial' #version declaration is '#version unofficial megapov 0.7 ;'. 

<p>
Custom versions may only be distributed as freeware and under terms no less restrictive than this 
license. You must make all of your modifications to POV-Ray&trade; freely and publicly available with 
FULL SOURCE CODE to the modified portions of POV-Ray&trade; and must freely distribute full 
source to any new parts of the custom version. The goal is that users must be able to re-compile 
the program themselves using readily available compilers and run-time libraries and to be able to 
further improve the program with their own modifications. 

<p>
You must provide documentation for any and all modifications that you have made to the program 
that you are distributing and include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official 
POV-Ray&trade;. 

<p>
The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the POV-Team&trade;, but the team is 
in no way required to utilize these enhancements or fixes. By sending material to the team, the 
contributor asserts and warrants that he owns the materials or has the right to distribute these 
materials. He authorizes the team to use the materials any way they like. The contributor still 
retains rights to the donated material, but by donating, grants, and warrants that he is entitled to 
grant unrestricted, irrevocable usage and distribution rights to the POV-Team&trade; and indemnifies 
them against any claims of unauthorized use of the donated software or any technology contained 
or expressed within it. The team doesn't have to use the material, but if it does, you do not acquire 
any rights related to POV-Ray&trade;. The team may give you credit as the creator of new code if 
applicable. 

<p>
You must include a copy of the latest version of this document as obtained from 
<a href="http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html" target="new">http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html</a>,
and ensure that the user has agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of use as set out in this
License Agreement.  You indemnify the POV-Team for any harm or loss which they may suffer as a result
of your failure to do so.

<h4>CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING</h4>

<p>
Vendors wishing to bundle POV-Ray&trade; (or any software that is derived from it or any part of it) with
commercial software (including shareware) or any other use or distribution not already expressly
allowed above must first obtain express written permission from the POV-Team&trade;. The POV-Team&trade; will,
in its sole discretion, decide if such use will be allowed on a case-by-case basis and may impose
whatever conditions it sees fit. 

<p>
For commercial distribution, the minimum terms are given below. Other conditions may be 
imposed.

<p>
The product must be an existing product that has proven itself as commercially viable without 
POV-Ray&trade; included, unless the POV-Team expressly grants exception to this rule. Such exceptions
will not be granted unless it can be demonstrated that POV-Ray or the POV-Ray community would
somehow benefit from allowing such an exception.

<p>
The inclusion of POV-Ray&trade; should be promoted only as a free bonus and not as a feature 
designed to encourage customers to purchase or upgrade solely for the POV-Ray&trade; capability.

<p>
Purchasers of your product must not be led to believe that they are paying for POV-Ray&trade;. Any 
mention of the POV-Ray&trade; bundle on the box, in advertising or in instruction manuals must be 
clearly marked with a disclaimer that POV-Ray&trade; is free software and can be obtained for free or 
nominal cost from various sources.

<p>
You must include clear and obvious information on how to obtain POV-Ray&trade; via our official 
distribution points.

<h4>POV-TEAM ENDORSEMENT PROHIBITION</h4>

<p>
On rare occasions, the POV-Team&trade; endorses distributions in which POV-Team&trade; members are 
compensated participants and to which the POV-Team&trade; has given approval. 

<p>
Without specific approval, distributors (whether free or commercial) must not claim or imply in any 
way that the POV-Team&trade; officially endorses or supports the distributor or the product (such as 
CD, book, or magazine) associated with the distribution. 

<p>
You may not claim or imply that the POV-Team&trade; derives any benefit from your distribution. 

<p>
If you wish to emphasize that your distribution is legal, you may use this language &quot;This 
distribution of the official version of POV-Ray&trade; is permitted under the terms of the General 
License in the file POVLEGAL.DOC. The POV-Team&trade; does not endorse the distributor or its 
products. The POV-Team&trade; receives no compensation for this distribution.&quot; 

<h4>RETAIL VALUE OF THIS SOFTWARE</h4>

<p>
Although POV-Ray&trade; is, when distributed within the terms of this agreement, free of charge, the 
retail value (or price) of this program is determined as US$30.00 per copy distributed or copied. If 
the Software is distributed or copied without authorization the person(s) or entity(ies) responsible 
or involved are each legally liable to the maximum extent permitted by law for the full amount of 
this debt to the copyright holder, or any other person or organization delegated by the copyright 
holder for the collection of this debt. 

<p>
However, the above paragraph in no way constitutes permission to distribute this Software outside 
of the terms of this agreement. In particular, the conditions and debt mentioned above (whether 
paid or unpaid) do not allow you to avoid statutory damages or other legal penalties and does not 
constitute any agreement that would allow you to avoid such other legal remedies as are available 
to the copyright holder. 

<p>
Put simply, POV-Ray&trade; is only free if you comply with our distribution conditions; it is not free 
otherwise. The copyright holder of this Software chooses to give it away free under these and only 
these conditions. If you distribute this Software in violation of this license, what you are doing is no 
different than if you took a copy of a commercial software product and distributed it without the 
permission of the copyright holder of that product. 

<p>
For the purpose of copyright regulations and/or statutory damages provisions, the retail value of 
this Software is US$30.00 per copy. 

<h4>USE OF THE POV-RAY SCENE LANGUAGE</h4>

<p>
The team permits and encourages the creation of programs, including commercial packages, 
which import, export or translate files in the POV-Ray&trade; Scene Description Language. Subject to 
the requirement in the following paragraph, there are no restrictions on the use of the language 
itself (this does not include the source code that we use to implement the language). 

<p>
The POV-Team&trade; reserves the right to add or remove or change any part of the language. Prior to 
using the POV-Ray&trade; scene language, you agree that you will not hold the POV-Team&trade;, or 
anyone associated with it, or the contributor or author or initiator of any such change, in any way 
responsible for whatever happens to you or your product, program, or whatever use you put the 
scene language to, as a direct or indirect result of any such change or changes. This explicitly 
includes, but is not limited to, any lost compatibility, lost profits, bugs, extra development or 
maintenance, public or private embarrassment or public relations problems.  Your attention is 
drawn to the &quot;NO LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY &quot; provisions above to which you agree to be bound.

<h4>TRADEMARKS</h4>

<p>
&quot;POV-Ray&trade;&quot;, &quot;Persistence of Vision&quot;, &quot;POV-Team&trade;&quot; and &quot;POV-Help&quot; are trademarks of the 
POV-Team&trade;. Any other trademarks referred to herein are the property of their respective holders.   
You undertake not to use, apply for, or register anywhere in the world, any word, name, trade mark 
or device which is substantially identical or deceptively or confusingly similar to any of the POV-
Team's&trade; trade marks.

<h4>REVOCATION OF LICENSE</h4>

<p>
VIOLATION OF THIS LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT LAWS. IT WILL RESULT IN 
REVOCATION OF ALL PRIVILEGES GRANTED BY IT AND MAY RESULT IN CIVIL OR 
CRIMINAL LIABILITY . 

<p>
Violators who are prohibited from distribution may from time to time be identified in this document. 

<p>
In this regard, &quot;PC Format&quot;, a magazine published at the time by Future Publishing, Ltd. in the 
United Kingdom, distributed incomplete versions of POV-Ray&trade; 1.0 in violation of the license 
which was in effect at the time. They later attempted to distribute POV-Ray&trade; 2.2 without prior 
permission of the POV-Team&trade; in violation of the license which was in effect at the time. After the 
POV-Team&trade; was made aware of their intent, they were contacted and were granted permission in 
return for certain promises they made. They subsequently failed to honor these promises. 

<p>
There is evidence that other Future Publishing companies have also violated our terms. PC 
Format's actions, particularly in relation to the incomplete v1.0 distribution (which simply didn't 
work properly due to files that had been deleted to fit on the magazine's cover floppy disk - 
causing many users to blame us for the faults and complain to us in email) caused us un-needed 
stress and support headaches. 

<p>
Therefore &quot;PC Format&quot;, and any other magazine, book, CD-ROM, or any other type of publication 
owned in whole or part by, or related in any other way, to Future Publishing is expressly prohibited 
from any distribution of POV-Ray&trade; software. 

<h4>MISCELLANEOUS</h4>

<p>
This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement concerning this license.  Any changes to this 
agreement must be in writing and may take the form of notifications by the POV-Team&trade; to you, or 
through posting notifications on our website. The use of this Software by any person is expressly 
made conditional on their acceptance of the terms set forth herein. If any provision of this 
Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability of such 
provision shall not affect the other provisions of this agreement and all provisions not affected by 
such invalidity or unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect.  You agree to attempt to 
substitute for invalid or unenforceable provision a valid or enforceable provision which achieves to 
the greatest extent possible, the objectives and intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision. 
The validity and interpretation of this agreement will be governed by the laws of Australia in the 
state of Victoria (except for conflict of law provisions).
