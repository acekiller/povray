<h3>6.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing the Camera</h3>

  <p>The POV-Ray camera has ten different models, each of which uses a
  different projection method to project the scene onto your screen. Regardless
  of the projection type all cameras use the <code>location</code>, <code>
  right</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>direction</code>, and keywords to
  determine the location and orientation of the camera. The type keywords and
  these four vectors fully define the camera. All other camera modifiers adjust
  how the camera does its job. The meaning of these vectors and other modifiers
  differ with the projection type used. A more detailed explanation of the
  camera types follows later. In the sub-sections which follows, we explain how
  to place and orient the camera by the use of these four vectors and the
  <code>sky</code> and <code> look_at</code> modifiers. You may wish to refer
  to the illustration of the perspective camera below as you read about these
  vectors.</p>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_716"></a>
<h4>6.4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Location and Look_At</h4>

<a name="target_717"></a>

  <p>Under many circumstances just two vectors in the camera statement are all
  you need to position the camera: <code>location</code> and <code>look_at</code>
  vectors. For example:</p>
<pre>
 camera {
  location &lt;3,5,-10&gt;
  look_at &lt;0,2,1&gt;
 }
</pre>

  <p>The location is simply the x, y, z coordinates of the camera. The camera
  can be located anywhere in the ray-tracing universe. The default location is
  <code>&lt;0,0,0&gt;</code>. The <code>look_at</code> vector tells POV-Ray to
  pan and tilt the camera until it is looking at the specified x, y, z
  coordinates. By default the camera looks at a point one unit in the
  z-direction from the location.</p><p>
   The <code>look_at</code> modifier should almost always be the last item in
  the camera statement. If other camera items are placed after the <code>
  look_at</code> vector then the camera may not continue to look at the
  specified point.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_718"></a>
<h4>6.4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sky Vector</h4>

<a name="target_719"></a>

  <p>Normally POV-Ray pans left or right by rotating about the y-axis until it
  lines up with the <code>look_at</code> point and then tilts straight up or
  down until the point is met exactly. However you may want to slant the camera
  sideways like an airplane making a banked turn. You may change the tilt of
  the camera using the <code>sky</code> vector. For example:</p>
<pre>
 camera {
  location &lt;3,5,-10&gt;
  sky   &lt;1,1,0&gt;
  look_at &lt;0,2,1&gt;
 }
</pre>

  <p>This tells POV-Ray to roll the camera until the top of the camera is in
  line with the sky vector. Imagine that the sky vector is an antenna pointing
  out of the top of the camera. Then it uses the <code>sky</code> vector as the
  axis of rotation left or right and then to tilt up or down in line with the
  <code>sky</code> until pointing at the <code>look_at</code> point. In effect
  you're telling POV-Ray to assume that the sky isn't straight up.</p><p>
   The <code>sky</code> vector does nothing on its own. It only modifies the
  way the <code>look_at</code> vector turns the camera. The default value is
  <code> sky&lt;0,1,0&gt;</code>.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">

<h4>6.4.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Angles</h4>

<a name="target_721"></a>

<a name="target_722"></a>
  <p>The <code>angle</code> keyword followed by a float expression specifies
  the (horizontal) viewing angle in degrees of the camera used. Even though it
  is possible to use the <code>direction</code> vector to determine the viewing
  angle for the perspective camera it is much easier to use the <code>
  angle</code> keyword.</p><p>
   When you specify the <code>angle</code>, POV-Ray adjusts the length of the
  <code>direction</code> vector accordingly. The formula used is <em>
  direction_length = 0.5 * right_length / tan(angle / 2)</em> where <em>
  right_length</em> is the length of the <code>right</code> vector. You should
  therefore specify the <code> direction</code> and <code> right</code> vectors
  before the <code> angle</code> keyword. The <code> right</code> vector is
  explained in the next section.</p><p>
   There is no limitation to the viewing angle except for the perspective
  projection. If you choose viewing angles larger than 360 degrees you'll
  see repeated images of the scene (the way the repetition takes place depends
  on the camera). This might be useful for special effects.</p>
  <p>
   The <code>spherical</code> camera has the option to also specify a vertical
   angle. If not specified it defaults to the horizontal angle/2</p>
  <p>
   For example if you render an image with a 2:1 aspect ratio and map it 
   to a sphere using spherical mapping, it will recreate the scene. Another 
   use is to map it onto an object and if you specify transformations for 
   the object before the texture, say in an animation, it will look like 
   reflections of the environment (sometimes called environment mapping).</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_723"></a>
<h4>6.4.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;The Direction Vector</h4>

<a name="target_724"></a>

  <p>You will probably not need to explicitly specify or change the camera
  <code>direction</code> vector but it is described here in case you do. It
  tells POV-Ray the initial direction to point the camera before moving it with
  the <code>look_at</code> or <code>rotate</code> vectors (the default value is
  <code>direction&lt;0,0,1&gt;</code>). It may also be used to control the
  (horizontal) field of view with some types of projection. The length of the
  vector determines the distance of the viewing plane from the camera's
  location. A shorter <code>direction</code> vector gives a wider view while a
  longer vector zooms in for close-ups. In early versions of POV-Ray, this was
  the only way to adjust field of view. However zooming should now be done
  using the easier to use <code>angle</code> keyword.</p><p>
   If you are using the <code>ultra_wide_angle</code>, <code>panoramic</code>,
  or <code> cylindrical</code> projection you should use a unit length <code>
  direction</code> vector to avoid strange results. The length of the <code>
  direction</code> vector doesn't matter when using the <code>
  orthographic</code>, <code>fisheye</code>, or <code>omnimax</code> projection
  types.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_725"></a>
<h4>6.4.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and Right Vectors</h4>

<a name="target_726"></a>

  <p>The primary purpose of the <code>up</code> and <code>right</code> vectors
  is to tell POV-Ray the relative height and width of the view screen. The
  default values are:</p>
<pre>
 right 4/3*x
 up y
</pre>

  <p>In the default <code>perspective</code> camera, these two vectors also
  define the initial plane of the view screen before moving it with the <code>
  look_at</code> or <code>rotate</code> vectors. The length of the <code>
  right</code> vector (together with the <code>direction</code> vector) may
  also be used to control the (horizontal) field of view with some types of
  projection. The <code>look_at</code> modifier changes both the <code>up</code>
  and <code>right</code> vectors. The <code>angle</code> calculation depends on the <code>
  right</code> vector.</p><p>
   Most camera types treat the <code>up</code> and <code> right</code> vectors
  the same as the <code>perspective</code> type. However several make special
  use of them. In the <code>orthographic</code> projection: The lengths of the
  <code> up</code> and <code>right</code> vectors set the size of the viewing
  window regardless of the <code> direction</code> vector length, which is not
  used by the orthographic camera.</p><p>
   When using <code>cylindrical</code> projection: types 1 and 3, the axis of
  the cylinder lies along the <code>up</code> vector and the width is
  determined by the length of <code>right</code> vector or it may be overridden
  with the <code>angle</code> vector. In type 3 the <code> up</code> vector
  determines how many units high the image is. For example if you have <code>up
  4*y</code> on a camera at the origin. Only points from y=2 to y=-2 are
  visible. All viewing rays are perpendicular to the y-axis. For type 2 and 4,
  the cylinder lies along the <code>right</code> vector. Viewing rays for type
  4 are perpendicular to the <code>right</code> vector.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> that the <code>up</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>
  direction</code> vectors should always remain perpendicular to each other or
  the image will be distorted. If this is not the case a warning message will
  be printed. The vista buffer will not work for non-perpendicular camera
  vectors.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_727"></a>
<h5>6.4.1.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspect Ratio</h5>

  <p>Together the <code>up</code> and <code>right</code> vectors define the
  <em>aspect ratio</em> (height to width ratio) of the resulting image. The
  default values <code>up&lt;0,1,0&gt;</code> and <code>
  right&lt;1.33,0,0&gt;</code> result in an aspect ratio of 4 to 3. This is the
  aspect ratio of a typical computer monitor. If you wanted a tall skinny image
  or a short wide panoramic image or a perfectly square image you should adjust
  the <code>up</code> and <code>right</code> vectors to the appropriate
  proportions.</p><p>
   Most computer video modes and graphics printers use perfectly square pixels.
  For example Macintosh displays and IBM SVGA modes 640x480, 800x600 and
  1024x768 all use square pixels. When your intended viewing method uses square
  pixels then the width and height you set with the <code> Width</code> and
  <code>Height</code> options or <code> +W</code> or <code> +H</code> switches
  should also have the same ratio as the <code>up</code> and <code>right</code>
  vectors.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> 640/480 = 4/3 so the ratio is proper for this square pixel
  mode.</p><p>
   Not all display modes use square pixels however. For example IBM VGA mode
  320x200 and Amiga 320x400 modes do not use square pixels. These two modes
  still produce a 4/3 aspect ratio image. Therefore images intended to be
  viewed on such hardware should still use 4/3 ratio on their <code>up</code>
  and <code>right</code> vectors but the pixel settings will not be 4/3.</p><p>
   For example:</p>
<pre>
 camera {
  location &lt;3,5,-10&gt;
  up    &lt;0,1,0&gt;
  right  &lt;1,0,0&gt;
  look_at &lt;0,2,1&gt;
 }
</pre>

  <p>This specifies a perfectly square image. On a square pixel display like
  SVGA you would use pixel settings such as <code>+W480 +H480</code> or <code>
  +W600 +H600</code>. However on the non-square pixel Amiga 320x400 mode you
  would want to use values of <code>+W240 +H400</code> to render a square
  image.</p><p>
   The bottom line issue is this: the <code>up</code> and <code> right</code>
  vectors should specify the artist's intended aspect ratio for the image
  and the pixel settings should be adjusted to that same ratio for square
  pixels and to an adjusted pixel resolution for non-square pixels. The <code>
  up</code> and <code>right</code> vectors should <em> not</em> be adjusted
  based on non-square pixels.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_728"></a>
<h5>6.4.1.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Handedness</h5>

  <p>The <code>right</code> vector also describes the direction to the right of
  the camera. It tells POV-Ray where the right side of your screen is. The sign
  of the <code>right</code> vector can be used to determine the handedness of
  the coordinate system in use. The default value is: <code>
  right&lt;1.33,0,0&gt;</code>. This means that the +x-direction is to the
  right. It is called a <em>left-handed</em> system because you can use your
  left hand to keep track of the axes. Hold out your left hand with your palm
  facing to your right. Stick your thumb up. Point straight ahead with your
  index finger. Point your other fingers to the right. Your bent fingers are
  pointing to the +x-direction. Your thumb now points into +y-direction. Your
  index finger points into the +z-direction.</p><p>
   To use a right-handed coordinate system, as is popular in some CAD programs
  and other ray-tracers, make the same shape using your right hand. Your thumb
  still points up in the +y-direction and your index finger still points
  forward in the +z-direction but your other fingers now say the +x-direction
  is to the left. That means that the right side of your screen is now in the
  -x-direction. To tell POV-Ray to act like this you can use a negative x value
  in the <code> right</code> vector such as: <code>
  right&lt;-1.33,0,0&gt;</code>. Since having x values increasing to the left
  doesn't make much sense on a 2D screen you now rotate the whole thing 180
  degrees around by using a positive z value in your camera's location. You
  end up with something like this.</p>
<pre>
 camera {
  location &lt;0,0,10&gt;
  up    &lt;0,1,0&gt;
  right  &lt;-1.33,0,0&gt;
  look_at &lt;0,0,0&gt;
 }
</pre>

  <p>Now when you do your ray-tracer's aerobics, as explained in the
  section &quot;<a href="povdoc_049.html#target_80">Understanding POV-Ray's Coordinate System</a>&quot;, you use
  your right hand to determine the direction of rotations.</p><p>
   In a two dimensional grid, x is always to the right and y is up. The two
  versions of handedness arise from the question of whether z points into the
  screen or out of it and which axis in your computer model relates to up in
  the real world.</p><p>
  Architectural CAD systems, like AutoCAD, tend to use the <em> God's
  Eye</em> orientation that the z-axis is the elevation and is the model's
  up direction. This approach makes sense if you're an architect looking at
  a building blueprint on a computer screen. z means up, and it increases
  towards you, with x and y still across and up the screen. This is the basic
  right handed system.</p><p>
  Stand alone rendering systems, like POV-Ray, tend to consider you as a
  participant. You're looking at the screen as if you were a photographer
  standing in the scene. The up direction in the model is now y, the same as up
  in the real world and x is still to the right, so z must be depth, which
  increases away from you into the screen. This is the basic left handed
  system.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_729"></a>
<h4>6.4.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Transforming the Camera</h4>

  <p>The various transformations such as <code>translate</code> and <code>
  rotate</code> modifiers can re-position the camera once you've defined
  it. For example:</p>
<pre>
 camera {
  location &lt; 0, 0, 0&gt;
  direction &lt; 0, 0, 1&gt;
  up    &lt; 0, 1, 0&gt;
  right   &lt; 1, 0, 0&gt;
  rotate  &lt;30, 60, 30&gt;
  translate &lt; 5, 3, 4&gt;
 }
</pre>

  <p>In this example, the camera is created, then rotated by 30 degrees about
  the x-axis, 60 degrees about the y-axis and 30 degrees about the z-axis, then
  translated to another point in space.</p>
