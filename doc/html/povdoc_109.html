<h3>3.9.12&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations Of Special Textures</h3>

  <p>There are a couple limitations to all of the special textures we have seen
  (from textures, pigment and normal maps through material maps). First, if we
  have used the default directive to set the default texture for all items in
  our scene, it will not accept any of the special textures discussed here.
  This is really quite minor, since we can always declare such a texture and
  apply it individually to all objects. It doesn't actually prevent us from
  doing anything we couldn't otherwise do.</p><p>
   The other is more limiting, but as we will shortly see, can be worked around
  quite easily. If we have worked with layered textures, we have already seen
  how we can pile multiple texture patterns on top of one another (as long as
  one texture has transparency in it). This very useful technique has a problem
  incorporating the special textures we have just seen as a layer. But there is
  an answer!</p><p>
   For example, say we have a layered texture called <code>
  Speckled_Metal</code>, which produces a silver metallic surface, and then
  puts tiny specks of rust all over it. Then we decide, for a really rusty
  look, we want to create patches of concentrated rust, randomly over the
  surface. The obvious approach is to create a special texture pattern, with
  transparency to use as the top layer. But of course, as we have seen, we
  wouldn't be able to use that texture pattern as a layer. We would just
  generate an error message. The solution is to turn the problem inside out,
  and make our layered texture part of the texture pattern instead, like
  this</p>
<pre>
  // This part declares a pigment for use
  // in the rust patch texture pattern
  #declare Rusty = pigment {
    granite
    color_map {
      [ 0 rgb &lt;0.2, 0, 0&gt; ]
      [ 1 Brown ]
    }
    frequency 20
  }
  // And this part applies it
  // Notice that our original layered texture
  // &quot;Speckled_Metal&quot; is now part of the map
  #declare Rust_Patches = texture {
    bozo
    texture_map {
      [ 0.0  pigment {Rusty} ]
      [ 0.75 Speckled_Metal ]
      [ 1.0  Speckled_Metal ]
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>And the ultimate effect is the same as if we had layered the rust patches
  on to the speckled metal anyway.</p><p>
   With the full array of patterns, pigments, normals, finishes, layered and
  special textures, there is now practically nothing we cannot create in the
  way of amazing textures. An almost infinite number of new possibilities are
  just waiting to be created!</p>
