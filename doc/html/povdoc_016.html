<h3>1.7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug Reporting via our News Server</h3>

Bug reports may be lodged about POV-Ray by posting them in the appropriate group on our news 
server, <a href="http://www.povray.org/groups.html" target="new" class="ExternalLink">»news.povray.org</a>. See 
http://www.povray.org/groups.html for information about the server, and particularly for 
information as to which group to use. The newsgroups are monitored by a dedicated group of 
folks known as the POV-Ray <a href="http://tag.povray.org" target="new"</a class="ExternalLink">»Technical Assistance
Group</a>, or 'TAG' for short. The TAG will take note of any properly-lodged bug reports and
pass them on to the developers. They, and other users, will often lend new users a hand in
getting up to speed.
<p>
You may like to remember, however, that no matter where you end up getting assistance from, 
users who show that they have looked in the docs and read the VFAQ etc will be much more 
likely to receive the response they want than someone who obviously has not done so.
<p>
Any messages or reports sent to us may (not necessarily will, but may) be reposted by us in 
our newsgroups, on USENET, or on our web site. If you do not wish your communication to be 
posted in this manner, please do not send us any.
<p>
You should not expect any reply to bug reports.
<p>
The minimum information to include in your bug report is

<ol>
<li>The version number of POV-Ray for Unix.</li>

<li>Your operating system or GNU/Linux distribution and version. It's surprising how many people 
fail to provide this basic piece of information. We need to know what version of Unix you are 
running.</li>

<li>Your computer ; what processor and how much memory.</li>

<li>A complete description of the problem and what led up to it. It will make it a lot easier to 
    track down if you can include a scene file that will cause the problem. If the file is large, 
    try removing parts until you have the minimum scene file that will cause the problem.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Warning">
<b>Note:</b> If posting on the news group or emailing someone for support, <i>never, ever</i>
include file attachments without asking first. The only exception is posting to a specifically-
designated binaries group on the POV-Ray news server.
