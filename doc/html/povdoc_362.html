<h3>9.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;POV-Ray viruses?</h3>

<p><i>&quot;Are there any POV-Ray viruses out there? Can one be done?&quot;</i></p>

<p>At the time of writing this documentation, no known viruses or trojans
made with the POV-Ray Scene Description Language (SDL) are known to
exist.</p>

<p>Due to the properties of the POV-Ray SDL, writing a working virus
(that is, a piece of code which spreads, without the user knowing,
by copying itself to non-infected files) is very difficult, if not
impossible to do. The main obstacle in making a POV-Ray virus is
that there's no way for the SDL code to reside in memory, infecting
files when it sees them; another problem is that there's no way to
get file listings in the POV-Ray SDL, so the code can't infect other
.pov files at parse time.</p>

<p>However, trojans (i.e. a malicious piece of code which attempts to
harm the system, but won't infect other files) are much more likely.
It is possible with the POV-Ray SDL to open a file and write
practically anything to it. This can be used to cause severe damage
to an unprotected file system.</p>

<p>Note, however, that in POV-Ray 3.5 the concept of I/O restrictions
was introduced in order to protect the user from these kinds of
malicious scripts. Setting the I/O restrictions properly will
prevent the SDL from being able to open files for writing (and
optionally even for reading). You should check that your copy of
POV-Ray 3.5 has these restrictions properly set, especially if you
render files not made by you. Note, however, that not all versions of
POV-Ray 3.5 for different platforms may have these restrictions implemented.
Consult section 1 of the POV-Ray 3.5 documentation for more details about the
I/O restrictions.</p>

<p>Regardless of this, it's always a good idea to run only scripts which
you have received from trusted sources. This is particularly true if
you are using a version of POV-Ray older than 3.5.</p>

<p>The POV-Ray community consists mostly of benevolent people and it is
generally safe to try POV-Ray scripts made by them. However, it is
often better to be safe than to be sorry.</p>
