<h3>3.7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Light Source Specials</h3>

<h4>3.7.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Shadowless Lights</h4>
<a name="target_164"></a>

  <p>Light sources can be assigned the <code>shadowless</code> keyword and no
  shadows will be cast due to its presence in a scene. Sometimes, scenes are
  difficult to illuminate properly using the lights we have chosen to
  illuminate our objects. It is impractical and unrealistic to apply a higher
  ambient value to the texture of every object in the scene. So instead, we
  would place a couple of <em>fill lights</em> around the scene. Fill lights
  are simply dimmer lights with the <code>shadowless</code> keyword that act to
  boost the illumination of other areas of the scene that may not be lit well.
  Let's try using one in our scene.</p><p>
   Remember the three colored area spotlights? We go back and un-comment them
  and comment out any other lights we have made. Now we add the following:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 20, 0&gt;
    color Gray50
    shadowless
  }
</pre>

  <p>This is a fairly dim light 20 units over the center of the scene. It will
  give a dim illumination to all objects including the plane in the background.
  We render it and see.</p>

<div class="divh4">

<h4>3.7.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Assigning an Object to a Light Source</h4>
<a name="target_166"></a>

  <p>Light sources are invisible. They are just a location where the light
  appears to be coming from. They have no true size or shape. If we want our
  light source to be a visible shape, we can use the <code>looks_like</code>
  keyword. We can specify that our light source can look like any object we
  choose. When we use <code>looks_like</code>, then <code>no_shadow</code> is
  applied to the object automatically. This is done so that the object will not
  block any illumination from the light source. If we want some blocking to
  occur (as in a lampshade), it is better to simply use a union to do the same
  thing. Let's add such an object to our scene. Here is a light bulb we
  have made just for this purpose:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Lightbulb = union {
    merge {
      sphere { &lt;0,0,0&gt;,1 }
      cylinder {
        &lt;0,0,1&gt;, &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
        scale &lt;0.35, 0.35, 1.0&gt;
        translate  0.5*z
      }
      texture {
        pigment {color rgb &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;}
        finish {ambient .8 diffuse .6}
      }
    }
    cylinder {
      &lt;0,0,1&gt;, &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
      scale &lt;0.4, 0.4, 0.5&gt;
      texture { Brass_Texture }
      translate  1.5*z
    }
    rotate -90*x
    scale .5
  }
</pre>

  <p>Now we add the light source:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 2, 0&gt;
    color White
    looks_like { Lightbulb }
  }
</pre>

  <p>Rendering this we see that a fairly believable light bulb now illuminates
  the scene. However, if we do not specify a high ambient value, the light bulb
  is not lit by the light source. On the plus side, all of the shadows fall
  away from the light bulb, just as they would in a real situation. The shadows
  are sharp, so let's make our bulb an area light:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 2, 0&gt;
    color White
    area_light &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;, 2, 2
    adaptive 1
    jitter
    looks_like { Lightbulb }
  }
</pre>

  <p>We note that we have placed this area light in the x-y-plane instead of
  the x-z-plane. We also note that the actual appearance of the light bulb is
  not affected in any way by the light source. The bulb must be illuminated by
  some other light source or by, as in this case, a high ambient value.</p>

<div class="divh4">

<h4>3.7.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Light Fading</h4>
<a name="target_168"></a>

  <p>If it is realism we want, it is not realistic for the plane to be evenly
  illuminated off into the distance. In real life, light gets scattered as it
  travels so it diminishes its ability to illuminate objects the farther it
  gets from its source. To simulate this, POV-Ray allows us to use two
  keywords: <code>fade_distance</code>, which specifies the distance at which
  full illumination is achieved, and <code>fade_power</code>, an exponential
  value which determines the actual rate of attenuation. Let's apply these
  keywords to our fill light.</p><p>
   First, we make the fill light a little brighter by changing <code>
  Gray50</code> to <code>Gray75</code>. Now we change that fill light as
  follows:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 20, 0&gt;
    color Gray75
    fade_distance 5
    fade_power 1
    shadowless
  }
</pre>

  <p>This means that the full value of the fill light will be achieved at a
  distance of 5 units away from the light source. The fade power of 1 means
  that the falloff will be linear (the light falls off at a constant rate). We
  render this to see the result.</p><p>
   That definitely worked! Now let's try a fade power of 2 and a fade
  distance of 10. Again, this works well. The falloff is much faster with a
  fade power of 2 so we had to raise the fade distance to 10.</p>
