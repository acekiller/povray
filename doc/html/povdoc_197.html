<h3>6.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are Interior and Media Necessary?</h3>

  <p>In previous versions of POV-Ray, most of the items in the <code>interior</code>
  statement were previously part of the <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1035">finish</a></code>
  statement. Also the <code>halo</code> statement which was once part of the
  <code><a href="povdoc_205.html#target_1001">texture</a></code> statement has been discontinued
  and has been replaced by the <code><a href="povdoc_218.html#target_1185">media</a></code> statement
  which is part of <code>interior</code>.</p><p>
  You are probably asking <strong>WHY?</strong> As explained earlier, the
  <code>interior</code> contains items which describe the properties of the
  interior of the object. This is in contrast to the <code>texture</code> which
  describes the surface properties only. However this is not just a
  philosophical change. There were serious inconsistencies in the old
  model.</p><p>
  The main problem arises when a <code><a href="povdoc_210.html#target_1072">texture_map</a></code>
  or other patterned texture is used. These features allow you to create 
  textures that are a blend of two textures and which vary the entire texture 
  from one point to another. It does its blending by fully evaluating the 
  apparent color as though only one texture was applied and then fully 
  reevaluating it with the other texture. The two final results are 
  blended.</p><p> It is totally illogical to have a ray enter an object with 
  one index or refraction and then recalculate with another index. The result 
  is not an average of the two ior values. Similarly it makes no sense to 
  have a ray enter at one ior and exit at a different ior without 
  transitioning between them along the way. POV-Ray only calculates 
  refraction as the ray enters or leaves. It cannot incrementally compute a 
  changing ior through the interior of an object. Real world objects such as 
  optical fibers or no-line bifocal eyeglasses can have variable iors but 
  POV-Ray cannot simulate them.</p><p>
   Similarly the <code>halo</code> calculations were not performed as the
  syntax implied. Using a <code>halo</code> in such multi-textured objects did
  not vary the <code>halo</code> through the interior of the object. Rather,
  it computed two separate halos through the whole object and averaged the
  results. The new design for <code>media</code> which replaces <code>
  halo</code> makes it possible to have media that varies throughout the
  interior of the object according to a pattern but it does so independently of
  the surface texture. Because there are other changes in the design of this
  feature which make it significantly different, it was not only moved to the
  <code>interior</code> but the name was changed.</p><p>
   During our development, someone asked if we will create patterned interiors
  or a hypothetical <code>interior_map</code> feature. We will not. That would
  defeat the whole purpose of moving these features in the first place. They
  cannot be patterned and have logical or self-consistent results.</p>
