<h3>6.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal</h3>

  <p>Ray-tracing is known for the dramatic way it depicts reflection,
  refraction and lighting effects. Much of our perception depends on the
  reflective properties of an object. Ray tracing can exploit this by playing
  tricks on our perception to make us see complex details that aren't
  really there.</p><p>
   Suppose you wanted a very bumpy surface on the object. It would be very
  difficult to mathematically model lots of bumps. We can however simulate the
  way bumps look by altering the way light reflects off of the surface.
  Reflection calculations depend on a vector called a <em> surface normal</em>
  vector. This is a vector which points away from the surface and is
  perpendicular to it. By artificially modifying (or perturbing) this normal
  vector you can simulate bumps. This is done by adding an optional <code>
  normal</code> statement.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> that attaching a normal pattern does not really modify the surface. It
  only affects the way light reflects or refracts at the surface so that it
  looks bumpy.</p>
  <p> The syntax is:
<pre>
NORMAL:
  normal { [NORMAL_IDENTIFIER] [NORMAL_TYPE] [NORMAL_MODIFIER...] }
NORMAL_TYPE:
  PATTERN_TYPE Amount |
  bump_map { BITMAP_TYPE &quot;bitmap.ext&quot; [BUMP_MAP_MODS...]}
NORMAL_MODIFIER:
  PATTERN_MODIFIER | NORMAL_LIST | normal_map { NORMAL_MAP_BODY } |
  slope_map{ SLOPE_MAP_BODY } | bump_size Amount |
  no_bump_scale Bool | accuracy Float
</pre>
</p>

  <p>Each of the items in a normal are optional but if they are present, they
  must be in the order shown. Any items after the <em>NORMAL_IDENTIFIER</em>
  modify or override settings given in the identifier. If no identifier is
  specified then the items modify the normal values in the current default
  texture. The <em>PATTERN_TYPE</em> may optionally be followed by a float
  value that controls the apparent depth of the bumps. Typical values range
  from 0.0 to 1.0 but any value may be used. Negative values invert the
  pattern. The default value if none is specified is 0.5.</p><p>
   There are four basic types of <em>NORMAL_TYPE</em>s. They are block pattern
  normals, continuous pattern normals, specialized normals and bump maps. They
  differ in the types of modifiers you may use with them. The pattern type is
  optionally followed by one or more normal modifiers. In addition to general
  pattern modifiers such as transformations, turbulence, and warp modifiers,
  normals may also have a <em>NORMAL_LIST</em>, <code>slope_map</code>, <code>
  normal_map</code>, and <code>bump_size</code> which are specific to normals.
  See &quot;<a href="povdoc_217.html#target_1143">Pattern Modifiers</a>&quot; for information on general modifiers. The
  normal-specific modifiers are described in sub-sections which follow. Normal
  modifiers of any kind apply only to the normal and not to other parts of the
  texture. Modifiers must be specified last.</p><p>
   Originally POV-Ray had some patterns which were exclusively used for
  pigments while others were exclusively used for normals. Since POV-Ray 3.0
  you can use any pattern for either pigments or normals. For example it is now
  valid to use <code>ripples</code> as a pigment or <code>wood</code> as a
  normal type. The patterns <code>bumps</code>, <code>dents</code>, <code>
  ripples</code>, <code>waves</code>, <code> wrinkles</code>, and <code>
  bump_map</code> were once exclusively normal patterns which could not be used
  as pigments. Because these six types use specialized normal modification
  calculations they cannot have <code> slope_map</code>, <code>
  normal_map</code> or wave shape modifiers. All other normal pattern types may
  use them. Because block patterns <code> checker</code>, <code>hexagon</code>, <code>object</code>
  and <code> brick</code> do not return a continuous series of values, they
  cannot use these modifiers either. See &quot;<a href="povdoc_216.html#target_1089">Patterns</a>&quot; for details about
  specific patterns.</p><p>
   A <code> normal</code> statement is part of a <code> texture</code>
  specification. However it can be tedious to use a <code> texture</code>
  statement just to add bumps to an object. Therefore you may attach a normal
  directly to an object without explicitly specifying that it as part of a
  texture. For example instead of this:</p>
<pre>
  object  {My_Object texture { normal { bumps 0.5 } } }
</pre>

  <p>you may shorten it to:</p>
<pre>
  object { My_Object normal { bumps 0.5 } }
</pre>

  <p>Doing so creates an entire <code>texture</code>
  structure with default <code>pigment</code> and <code>finish</code>
  statements just as if you had explicitly typed the full <code>
  texture {...}</code> around it. Normal identifiers may be declared to make
  scene files more readable and to parameterize scenes so that changing a
  single declaration changes many values. An identifier is declared as
  follows.</p>
<pre>
NORMAL_DECLARATION:
    #declare IDENTIFIER = NORMAL |
    #local IDENTIFIER = NORMAL
</pre>

  <p>Where <em>IDENTIFIER</em> is the name of the identifier up to 40
  characters long and <em>NORMAL</em> is any valid <code>normal</code>
  statement. See &quot;<a href="povdoc_167.html#target_663">#declare vs. #local</a>&quot; for information on identifier
  scope.</p>

<h4>6.7.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Slope Maps</h4>

<a name="target_1023"></a>

  <p>A <code>slope_map</code> is a normal pattern modifier which gives the user
  a great deal of control over the exact shape of the bumpy features. Each of
  the various pattern types available is in fact a mathematical function that
  takes any x, y, z location and turns it into a number between 0.0 and 1.0
  inclusive. That number is used to specify where the various high and low
  spots are. The <code>slope_map</code> lets you further shape the contours. It
  is best illustrated with a gradient normal pattern. Suppose you have...</p>
<pre>
  plane{ z, 0
    pigment{ White }
    normal { gradient x }
  }
</pre>

  <p>This gives a ramp wave pattern that looks like small linear ramps that
  climb from the points at x=0 to x=1 and then abruptly drops to 0 again to
  repeat the ramp from x=1 to x=2. A slope map turns this simple linear ramp
  into almost any wave shape you want. The syntax is as follows...</p>
<pre>
SLOPE_MAP:
    slope_map { SLOPE_MAP_BODY }
SLOPE_MAP_BODY:
    SLOPE_MAP_IDENTIFIER | SLOPE_MAP_ENTRY...
SLOPE_MAP_ENTRY:
    [ Value, &lt;Height, Slope&gt; ]
</pre>

  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> the <code>[]</code> brackets are part of the actual <em>
  SLOPE_MAP_ENTRY</em>. They are not notational symbols denoting optional
  parts. The brackets surround each entry in the slope map.</p><p>There may be from 2
  to 256 entries in the map.</p><p>
   Each <em><code>Value</code></em> is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0
  inclusive and each <em><code> &lt;Height</code></em>, <em> <code>
  Slope&gt;</code></em> is a 2 component vector such as &lt;0,1&gt; where the
  first value represents the apparent height of the wave and the second value
  represents the slope of the wave at that point. The height should range
  between 0.0 and 1.0 but any value could be used.</p><p>
   The slope value is the change in height per unit of distance. For example a
  slope of zero means flat, a slope of 1.0 means slope upwards at a 45 degree
  angle and a slope of -1 means slope down at 45 degrees. Theoretically a slope
  straight up would have infinite slope. In practice, slope values should be
  kept in the range -3.0 to +3.0. Keep in mind that this is only the visually
  apparent slope. A normal does not actually change the surface.</p><p>
   For example here is how to make the ramp slope up for the first half and
  back down on the second half creating a triangle wave with a sharp peak in
  the center.</p>
<pre>
  normal {
    gradient x       // this is the PATTERN_TYPE
    slope_map {
      [0   &lt;0, 1&gt;]   // start at bottom and slope up
      [0.5 &lt;1, 1&gt;]   // halfway through reach top still climbing
      [0.5 &lt;1,-1&gt;]   // abruptly slope down
      [1   &lt;0,-1&gt;]   // finish on down slope at bottom
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>The pattern function is evaluated and the result is a value from 0.0 to
  1.0. The first entry says that at x=0 the apparent height is 0 and the slope
  is 1. At x=0.5 we are at height 1 and slope is still up at 1. The third entry
  also specifies that at x=0.5 (actually at some tiny fraction above 0.5) we
  have height 1 but slope -1 which is downwards. Finally at x=1 we are at
  height 0 again and still sloping down with slope -1.</p><p>
   Although this example connects the points using straight lines the shape is
  actually a cubic spline. This example creates a smooth sine wave.</p>
<pre>
  normal {
    gradient x          // this is the PATTERN_TYPE
    slope_map {
      [0    &lt;0.5, 1&gt;]   // start in middle and slope up
      [0.25 &lt;1.0, 0&gt;]   // flat slope at top of wave
      [0.5  &lt;0.5,-1&gt;]   // slope down at mid point
      [0.75 &lt;0.0, 0&gt;]   // flat slope at bottom
      [1    &lt;0.5, 1&gt;]   // finish in middle and slope up
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>This example starts at height 0.5 sloping up at slope 1. At a fourth of
  the way through we are at the top of the curve at height 1 with slope 0 which
  is flat. The space between these two is a gentle curve because the start and
  end slopes are different. At half way we are at half height sloping down to
  bottom out at 3/4ths. By the end we are climbing at slope 1 again to complete
  the cycle. There are more examples in <code> slopemap.pov</code> in the
  sample scenes.</p><p>
   A <code>slope_map</code> may be used with any pattern except <code>
  brick</code>, <code>checker</code>, <code>object</code>, <code>hexagon</code>, <code>
  bumps</code>, <code>dents</code>, <code> ripples</code>, <code>waves</code>,
  <code> wrinkles</code> and <code> bump_map</code>.</p><p>
   You may declare and use slope map identifiers. For example:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Fancy_Wave =
    slope_map {       // Now let's get fancy
      [0.0  &lt;0, 1&gt;]   // Do tiny triangle here
      [0.2  &lt;1, 1&gt;]   //  down
      [0.2  &lt;1,-1&gt;]   //     to
      [0.4  &lt;0,-1&gt;]   //       here.
      [0.4  &lt;0, 0&gt;]   // Flat area
      [0.5  &lt;0, 0&gt;]   //   through here.
      [0.5  &lt;1, 0&gt;]   // Square wave leading edge
      [0.6  &lt;1, 0&gt;]   //   trailing edge
      [0.6  &lt;0, 0&gt;]   // Flat again
      [0.7  &lt;0, 0&gt;]   //   through here.
      [0.7  &lt;0, 3&gt;]   // Start scallop
      [0.8  &lt;1, 0&gt;]   //   flat on top
      [0.9  &lt;0,-3&gt;]   //     finish here.
      [0.9  &lt;0, 0&gt;]   // Flat remaining through 1.0
    }
  object{ My_Object
    pigment { White }
    normal {
      wood
      slope_map { Fancy_Wave }
    }
  }

<h5>6.7.2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Normals, Accuracy</h5>
<p>Surface normals that use patterns that were not designed for use with normals (anything other than bumps, dents, waves, ripples, and wrinkles) uses a <code>slope_map</code> whether you specify one or not. To create a perturbed normal from a pattern, POV-Ray samples the pattern at four points in a pyramid surrounding the desired point to determine the gradient of the pattern at the center of the pyramid. The distance that these points are from the center point determines the accuracy of the approximation. Using points too close together causes floating-point inaccuracies. However, using points too far apart can lead to artefacts as well as smoothing out features that should not be smooth.</p>

<p>Usually, points very close together are desired. POV-Ray currently uses a delta or accuracy distance of 0.02. Sometimes it is necessary to decrease this value to get better accuracy if you are viewing a close-up of the texture. Other times, it is nice to increase this value to smooth out sharp edges in the normal (for example, when using a 'solid' crackle pattern). For this reason, a new property, <code>accuracy</code>, has been added to normals. It only makes a difference if the normal uses a <code>slope_map</code> (either specified or implied).</p> 

<p>You can specify the value of this accuracy (which is the distance between the sample points when determining the gradient of the pattern for slope_map) by adding <code>accuracy &lt;float&gt;</code> to your normal. For all patterns, the default is 0.02.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1025"></a>
<h4>6.7.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal Maps and Normal Lists</h4>

<a name="target_1026"></a>

  <p>Most of the time you will apply single normal pattern to an entire surface
  but you may also create a pattern or blend of normals using a <code>
  normal_map</code>. The syntax for a <code>normal_map</code> is identical to a
  <code>pigment_map</code> except you specify a <code> normal</code> in each
  map entry. The syntax for <code>normal_map</code> is as follows:</p>
<pre>
NORMAL_MAP:
    normal_map { NORMAL_MAP_BODY }
NORMAL_MAP_BODY:
    NORMAL_MAP_IDENTIFIER | NORMAL_MAP_ENTRY...
NORMAL_MAP_ENTRY:
    [ Value NORMAL_BODY ]
</pre>

  <p>Where <em><code>Value</code></em> is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0
  inclusive and each <em>NORMAL_BODY</em> is anything which can be inside a
  <code>normal{...}</code> statement. The <code>normal</code> keyword and
  <code>{}</code> braces need not be specified.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> that the <code>[]</code> brackets are part of the actual <em>
  NORMAL_MAP_ENTRY</em>. They are not notational symbols denoting optional
  parts. The brackets surround each entry in the normal map.</p><p> There may be from
  2 to 256 entries in the map.</p><p>
   For example</p>
<pre>
  normal {
    gradient x       //this is the PATTERN_TYPE
    normal_map {
      [0.3  bumps scale 2]
      [0.3  dents]
      [0.6  dents]
      [0.9  marble turbulence 1]
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>When the <code>gradient x</code> function returns values from 0.0 to 0.3
  then the scaled bumps normal is used. From 0.3 to 0.6 dents pattern is used.
  From 0.6 up to 0.9 a blend of dents and a turbulent marble is used. From 0.9
  on up only the turbulent marble is used.</p><p>
   Normal maps may be nested to any level of complexity you desire. The normals
  in a map may have slope maps or normal maps or any type of normal you
  want.</p><p>
   A normal map is also used with the <code>average</code> normal type. See
  &quot;Average&quot; for details.</p><p>
   Entire normals in a normal list may also be used with the block patterns
  such as <code>checker</code>, <code>hexagon</code> and <code>brick</code>.
  For example...</p>
<pre>
  normal {
    checker
    normal { gradient x scale .2 }
    normal { gradient y scale .2 }
  }
</pre>

  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> in the case of block patterns the <code>normal</code> wrapping
  is required around the normal information.</p><p>
   You may not use <code> normal_map</code> or individual normals with a <code>
  bump_map</code>. See section &quot;<a href="povdoc_210.html#target_1071">Texture Maps</a>&quot; for an alternative way
  to do this.</p><p>
   You may declare and use normal map identifiers but the only way to declare a
  normal block pattern list is to declare a normal identifier for the entire
  normal.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1027"></a>
<h4>6.7.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Bump Maps</h4>

<a name="target_1028"></a>

  <p>When all else fails and none of the above normal pattern types meets your
  needs you can use a <code>bump_map</code> to wrap a 2-D bit-mapped bump
  pattern around your 3-D objects.</p><p>
   Instead of placing the color of the image on the shape like an <code>
  image_map</code> a <code>bump_map</code> perturbs the surface normal based on
  the color of the image at that point. The result looks like the image has
  been embossed into the surface. By default, a bump map uses the brightness of
  the actual color of the pixel. Colors are converted to gray scale internally
  before calculating height. Black is a low spot, white is a high spot. The
  image's index values may be used instead (see section &quot;<a href="#target_1032">Use_Index</a>
  and <a href="#target_1032">Use_Color</a>&quot; below).</p>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_1029"></a>
<h5>6.7.2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifying a Bump Map</h5>

  <p>The syntax for a <code>bump_map</code> is:</p>
<pre>
BUMP_MAP:
    normal
    {
        bump_map
        {
            BITMAP_TYPE &quot;bitmap.ext&quot;
            [BUMP_MAP_MODS...]
        }
        [NORMAL_MODFIERS...]
    }
BITMAP_TYPE:
    gif | tga | iff | ppm | pgm | png | jpeg | tiff | sys
BUMP_MAP_MOD:
    map_type Type | once | interpolate Type | use_color | 
    use_colour | bump_size Value
</pre>

  <p>After the required <em>BITMAP_TYPE</em> keyword is a string expression
  containing the name of a bitmapped bump file of the specified type. Several
  optional modifiers may follow the file specification. The modifiers are
  described below.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> earlier versions of POV-Ray allowed some modifiers
  before the <em>BITMAP_TYPE</em> but that syntax is being phased out in favor
  of the syntax described here.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>sys</code> format is a
  system-specific format such as BMP for Windows or Pict for Macintosh.</p><p>
  Filenames specified in the <code>bump_map</code> statements will be searched
  for in the home (current) directory first and, if not found, will then be
  searched for in directories specified by any <code>+L</code> or <code>
  Library_Path</code> options active. This would facilitate keeping all your
  bump maps files in a separate subdirectory and giving a <code>
  Library_Path</code> option to specify where your library of bump maps are.
  See &quot;<a href="povdoc_150.html#target_436">Library Paths</a>&quot; for details.</p><p>
   By default, the bump pattern is mapped onto the x-y-plane. The bump pattern
  is <em>projected</em> onto the object as though there were a slide projector
  somewhere in the -z-direction. The pattern exactly fills the square area from
  (x,y) coordinates (0,0) to (1,1) regardless of the pattern's original
  size in pixels. If you would like to change this default you may translate,
  rotate or scale the pigment or texture to map it onto the object's
  surface as desired. If you would like to change this default orientation you
  may translate, rotate or scale the pigment or texture to map it onto the
  object's surface as desired.</p><p>
   The file name is optionally followed by one or more <em>
  BITMAP_MODIFIERS</em>. The <code>bump_size</code>, <code> use_color</code>
  and <code> use_index</code> modifiers are specific to bump maps and are
  discussed in the following sections. See section &quot;<a href="povdoc_217.html#target_1178">Bitmap Modifiers</a>&quot;
  for the generic bitmap modifiers <code>map_type</code>, <code>once</code> and
  <code> interpolate</code> described in &quot;Bitmap Modifiers&quot;</p>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_1030"></a>
<h5>6.7.2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Bump_Size</h5>

  <p>The relative bump size can be scaled using the <code>bump_size</code>
  modifier. The bump size number can be any number other than 0 but typical
  values are from about 0.1 to as high as 4.0 or 5.0.</p>
<pre>
  normal {
    bump_map {
      gif &quot;stuff.gif&quot;
      bump_size 5.0
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>Originally <code>bump_size</code> could only be used inside a bump map but
  it can now be used with any normal. Typically it is used to override a
  previously defined size. For example:</p>
<pre>
  normal {
    My_Normal   //this is a previously defined normal identifier
    bump_size 2.0
  }
</pre>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_1031"></a>
<h5>6.7.2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Use_Index and Use_Color</h5>

<a name="target_1032"></a>

  <p>Usually the bump map converts the color of the pixel in the map to a gray
  scale intensity value in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and calculates the bumps based
  on that value. If you specify <code>use_index</code>, the bump map uses the
  color's palette number to compute as the height of the bump at that
  point. So, color number 0 would be low and color number 255 would be high (if
  the image has 256 palette entries). The actual color of the pixels
  doesn't matter when using the index. This option is only available on
  palette based formats. The <code>use_color</code> keyword may be specified to
  explicitly note that the color methods should be used instead. The alternate
  spelling <code>use_colour</code> is also valid. These modifiers may only be
  used inside the <code>bump_map</code> statement.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1033"></a>
<h4>6.7.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Scaling normals</h4>
<a name="target_1034"></a>

  <p>When scaling a normal, or when scaling an object after a normal 
  is applied to it, the depth of the normal is affected by the scaling. This is 
  not always wanted. If you want to turn off bump scaling for a texture or normal, 
  you can do this by adding the keyword <code>no_bump_scale</code> to the texture's 
  or normal's modifiers. This modifier will get passed on to all textures or normals 
  contained in that texture or normal. Think of this like the way no_shadow gets 
  passed on to objects contained in a CSG.</p>
  <p>It is also important to note that if you add <code>no_bump_scale</code> to a normal or 
  texture that is contained within another pattern (such as within a <code>texture_map</code>
  or <code>normal_map</code>), then the only scaling that will be ignored is the scaling of that 
  texture or normal. Scaling of the parent texture or normal or of the object will 
  affect the depth of the bumps, unless <code>no_bump_scale</code> is specified at the top-level 
  of the texture (or normal, if the normal is not wrapped in a texture).</p>
