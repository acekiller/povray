<h4>9.1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Using several transparent objects makes them black?</h4>

<p><i>&quot;When I put several
transparent objects one in front of another or inside another, POV-Ray
calculates a few of them, but the rest are completely black, no matter
what transparency values I give.&quot;</i>

</p><p>Short answer: Try increasing the <code>max_trace_level</code>
value in the <code>global_settings</code> block (the default is 5).

</p><p>Long answer:

</p><p>Raytracing has a peculiar feature: It can calculate
reflection and refraction. Each time a ray hits the surface of an
object, the program looks if this surface is reflective and/or
refractive. If so, it shoots another ray from this point to the
appropriate direction.

</p><p>Now, imagine we have a glass sphere. Glass
reflects and refracts, so when the ray hits the sphere, two additional
rays are calculated, one outside the sphere (for the reflection) and
one inside (for the refraction). Now the inside ray will hit the
sphere again, so two new rays are calculated, and so on and so
on...

</p><p>You can easily see that there must be a maximum number of
reflections/refractions calculated, because otherwise POV-Ray would
calculate that one pixel forever.

</p><p>This number can be set with the
<code>max_trace_level</code> option in the <code>global_settings</code> block.
The default value
is 5, which is enough for most scenes. Sometimes it isn't enough
(specially when there are lots of semitransparent objects one over
another) so you have to increase it.

</p><p>So try something like:
<pre>
global_settings
{
  max_trace_level 10
}
</pre>

<h4>9.1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting color banding in the image.</h4>

<p><i>&quot;When I make an image with POV-Ray, it seems to use just a few colors
since I get color banding or concentric circles of colors or whatever where
it shouldn't. How can I make POV-Ray to use more colors?&quot;</i>

</p><p>POV-Ray always writes true color images (ie. with 16777216 colors, ie.
256 shades of red, 256 shades of green and 256 shades of blue) (this can
be changed when outputting to PNG or to B/W TGA but this is irrelevant when
answering to this question).

</p><p>So POV-Ray is not guilty. It always uses the maximum color resolution
available in the target image file format.

</p><p>This problem usually happens when you are using windows with 16-bit
colors (ie. only 65536 colors, the so-called hicolor mode) and open
the image created by POV-Ray with a program which doesn't dither the
image. The image is still true color, but the program is unable to
show all the colors, but shows only 65536 of them (dithering is a
method that &quot;fakes&quot; more colors by mixing pixels of two adjacent
colors to simulate the in-between colors).

</p><p>So the problem is not
in POV-Ray, but in your image viewer program. Even if POV-Ray shows a
poor image while rendering because you have a resolution with too few
colors, the image file created will have full color range.

<h4>9.1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotation behaves very strangely.</h4>

<p><i>&quot;When I rotate an object, it dissapears from the image or moves very
strangely. Why?&quot;</i>

</p><p>You need to understand how rotation works in POV-Ray.

</p><p>Objects are <u>always</u> rotated around the axes. When you rotate, for
example, <code>&lt;20,0,0&gt;</code>, that means that you are rotating
around the X-axis
20 degrees (counter-clockwise). This is independent of the location of the
object: It always rotates around the axis (what's the center of the object
anyways? how do you locate it?). This means that if the object is not
centered in the axis, it will orbit this axis like the Moon orbits the Earth
(showing always the same side to the Earth).

</p><p>It's a very good practice to define all objects centered at the origin
(ie. its 'center' is located at <code>&lt;0,0,0&gt;</code>). Then you
can rotate it
arbitrarily. After this you can translate it to its proper location in the
scene. It's a good idea to do this to every object even if you don't rotate
it (because you can't never say if you will rotate it some day nevertheless).

</p><p>What if, after all, you have a very complex object defined, but its
center is not at the origin, and you want to rotate it around its center?
Then you can just translate it to the origin, rotate it and then translate
it back to its place. Suppose that the center of the object is located at
<code>&lt;10,20,-30&gt;</code>; you can rotate it this way:

<pre>
translate -&lt;10,20,-30&gt;
rotate &lt;whatever&gt;
translate &lt;10,20,-30&gt;
</pre></p>

<h4>9.1.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;The image gets distorted when rendering a square image.</h4>

<p><i>&quot;If I tell POV-Ray to render a square image or otherwise change the
aspect ratio, the output image is distorted. What am I doing wrong?&quot;</i>

</p><p>The problem is that the camera is set to an aspect ratio of 4/3, while the
picture you are trying to render has an aspect ratio of 1/1 (or whatever).

</p><p>You can set the aspect ratio with the 'right' keyword in the camera block.
The general way to set the correct aspect ratio for your image dimensions is:

<pre>
camera
{ right x*ImageWidth/ImageHeight
  (other camera settings...)
}
</pre>

</p><p>This keyword can also be used to change the handedness of POV-Ray (see the
question about
<a href="povdoc_tgt.html#target_1894">Moray and POV-Ray handedness</a>
for more details).

</p><p>Note: One could think &quot;why doesn't POV-Ray always set
automatically the aspect ratio of the camera according to the resolution of
the image?&quot;.

</p><p>There's one thing wrong in this thought: It assumes that pixels are always
square (ie. the aspect ratio of the pixels is 1/1). The logic of this
behaviour comes clear with an example:

</p><p>Suppose that you design a scene using a regular 4/3 aspect
ratio, as usual (like 320x240, 640x480 and so on). This image is designed
to look good when viewing in a 4/3 monitor (as they all are in home computers).

</p><p>
Now you want to render this image for the Windows startup image. The resolution
of the Windows startup image is 320x400. This resolution has not an aspect
ratio of 4/3 and the pixels are not square (the pixels have an aspect ratio
of 1/0.6 instead of 1/1). Now, when you render your image at a resolution
of 320x400 with POV-Ray and show it with the monitor set to that resolution
(as it is set at windows startup when the startup image is shown), the
aspect ratio will be the correct one so the image will have the correct
proportions (and it will not be squeezed in any direction).

</p><p>If you had changed the aspect ratio of the camera to 320/400 (instead of
using the default 4/3) you would not only have got a different image (showing
parts of the scene not shown in the original or hiding parts visible in
the original), but it would have looked sqeezed when shown in the 320x400
screen resolution.

</p><p>Thus, the camera aspect ratio is the aspect ratio of the
final image on screen, when viewed in the final resolution (which might not
be a 4/3-resolution). Since the monitor screen has an aspect ratio of 4/3,
this is the default for the camera as well.

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1648"></a>
<h4>9.1.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there strange dark pixels or noise on my CSG object?</h4>

<p>This is the typical 'coincident surfaces problem'. This happens when two
surfaces are exactly at the same place. For example:

<pre>
union
{ box { &lt;-1,0,-1&gt;,&lt;1,-2,1&gt; texture { Texture1 } }
  box { &lt;-2,0,-2&gt;,&lt;2,-1,2&gt; texture { Texture2 } }
}
</pre>

</p><p>The top surface of the first box is coincident with the top surface of the
second box. When a ray hits this area, POV-Ray has to decide which surface
is closest. It can't, since they are exactly in the same place.
Which one it actually chooses depends on the float number calculations,
rounding error, initial parameters, position of the camera, etc, and varies from 
pixel to pixel, causing those seemingly &quot;random&quot; pixels.

</p><p>The solution to the problem is to decide which surface you want to
be on top and translate that surface just a bit, so it protrudes past
the unwanted surface. In the example above, if we
want, for example, that the second box is at the top, we will type something
like:

<pre>
union
{ box { &lt;-1,0,-1&gt;,&lt;1,-2,1&gt; texture { Texture1 } }
  box { &lt;-2,0.001,-2&gt;,&lt;2,-1,2&gt; texture { Texture2 } }
}
</pre>

</p><p>Note that a similar problem appears when a light source is exactly on a
surface: POV-Ray can't calculate accurately if it's actually inside or
outside the surface, so dark (shadowed) pixels appear on every surface that
is illuminated by this light.

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1649"></a>
<h4>9.1.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Why won't the textures in stars.inc work with my sky_sphere?</h4>

<p>The only thing that works with a <code>sky_sphere</code> is pigments.
Textures and
finishes are not allowed. Don't be discouraged though because you can still
use the textures in stars.inc with the following method:

</p><p>Extract only the pigment statement from the declared textures.
For example:

<pre>
texture
{ pigment { color_map { [0 rgb ...][.5 rgb ...][1.0 rgb ...] } scale ... }
  finish { ... }
}
</pre> 

</p><p>becomes:

<pre>
pigment { color_map { [0 rgb ...][.5 rgb ...][1.0 rgb ...] } scale ... }
</pre>

</p><p>The reason for this is that <code>sky_sphere</code> doesn't have a
surface, it isn't an actual object. It is really just a fancy version of the
background feature which extracts a color from a pigment instead of
being a flat color. Because of this, normal and finish features, which
depend on the characteristics of the surface of an object for their
calculations, can't be used. The textures in <code>stars.inc</code> were
intended to be mapped onto a real sphere, and can be used something like this:

<pre>
sphere
{ 0, 1
  hollow // So it doesn't interfere with any media in the scene
  texture { YourSkyTexture }
  scale 100000
}
</pre>

<a name="target_1650"></a>
<h4>9.1.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;When I use filter or transmit with my .tga image map nothing happens.</h4>

<p>
POV-Ray can only apply filter or transmit to 8 bit 256 color palleted
images. Since most <code>.tga</code>, <code>.png</code>, and <code>.bmp</code>
images are 24bit and 16 million
colors they do not work with filter or transmit. If you must use filter
or transmit with your image maps you must reduce the color depth to a
format the supports 256 colors such as the <code>.gif</code> image format.

</p><p>You might
also check the POV-Ray docs on using the alpha channel of <code>.png</code>
files if you need specific areas that are transparent.

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1651"></a>
<h4>9.1.2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Isosurface not rendering properly?</h4>

<p><i>&quot;My isosurface is not rendering properly: there are holes or random
noise or big parts or even the whole isosurface just disappears.&quot;</i>

</p><p>The most common reason for these type of phenomena with isosurfaces is
a too low <code>max_gradient</code> value. Use <code>evaluate</code> to
make POV-Ray calculate a proper <code>max_gradient</code> for the isosurface
(remember to specify a sensible <code>max_gradient</code> even when you use
<code>evaluate</code> or else the result may not be correct).

</p><p>Sometimes a too high <code>accuracy</code> value can also cause problems
even when the <code>max_gradient</code> is ok. If playing with the latter
doesn't seem to help, try also lowering the <code>accuracy</code>.

</p><p>Remember that specifying a <code>max_gradient</code> which is too
high for an isosurface, although it gives the correct result, is needlessly
slow, so you should always calculate the proper <code>max_gradient</code> for
each isosurface you make.</p>

<p>Note that there are certain pathological functions where no
<code>max_gradient</code> or <code>accuracy</code> will help.
These functions usually have discontinuities or
similar &quot;ill-behaving&quot; properties. With those you just have to find a solution
which gives the best quality/speed tradeoff. Isosurfaces work best with
functions which give smooth surfaces.
