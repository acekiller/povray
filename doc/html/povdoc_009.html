<h2>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O Restrictions</h2>

NOTE: I/O Restrictions are not yet available under POV-Ray for Unix 3.5, but will be available
in a future minor release.  The following documentation describes planned functionality.

<p>
I/O Restrictions are a new feature with POV-Ray for Unix 3.5. The purpose of this feature
is to attempt to at least partially protect a machine running POV-Ray from having files
read or written outside of a given set of directories.

<p>
The need for this is related to the fact that the POV-Ray scene language has, over the years,
become something more akin to a scripting language combined with a scene-description model.
It is now possible to write obsfucated POV-Ray code, and to open, create, read and write
arbitrary files anywhere on the target system's hard disk (subject to operating system
permission).

<p>
The basic idea of I/O Restrictions is to attempt to protect the user from a script that may 
have been downloaded from an untrusted source, and which may attempt to create or modify files 
that it should not.

<p>
The I/O Restriction facility hooks the file open and creation functions in the core POV-Ray
renderer code, and allows the Unix version to allow or deny any particular file operation.

<p>
We do not guarantee that the I/O Restriction facility will actually stop anything from 
happening. There is always the chance that, like almost all software, it could have a bug in 
it that causes it to malfunction. Therefore, the onus is on the person who chooses to load an 
INI or scene file into POV-Ray to ensure that it does not do anything that it should not do. 
Please consider I/O Restrictions just a sometimes-helpful backup for manual checks.

<p>
Please read this section in full so that you understand the caveats and conditions of the 
facility (such as the fact that some directories are allowed by default).
