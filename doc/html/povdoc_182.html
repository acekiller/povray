<h3>6.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of Projection</h3>

  <p>The following list explains the different projection types that can be
  used with the camera. The most common types are the perspective and
  orthographic projections. The <em>CAMERA_TYPE</em> should be the
  <em>first</em> item in a <code>camera</code> statement. If none is specified,
  the <code>perspective</code> camera is the default.</p>
  <p>You should note that the vista buffer can only be used with the
  perspective and orthographic camera.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_731"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Perspective projection</h4>

  <p>The <code>perspective</code> keyword
  specifies the default perspective camera which simulates the classic pinhole
  camera. The (horizontal) viewing angle is either determined by the ratio
  between the length of the <code>direction</code> vector and the length of the
  <code> right</code> vector or by the optional keyword <code>angle</code>,
  which is the preferred way. The viewing angle has to be larger than 0 degrees
  and smaller than 180 degrees. See the figure in &quot;Placing the
  Camera&quot; for the geometry of the perspective camera.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_732"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Orthographic projection</h4>

  <p>The orthographic camera offers two modes of operation:</p>

  <p>The pure <code>orthographic</code> projection. This projection uses parallel camera
  rays to create an image of the scene. The area of view is determined by the
  lengths of the <code>right</code> and <code>up</code> vectors.
  One of these has to be specified, they are not taken from the default
  camera. If omitted the second method of the camera is used.</p>

  <p>If, in a perspective camera, you replace the <code>perspective</code> keyword by
  <code>orthographic</code> and leave all other parameters the same, you'll get an
  orthographic view with the same image area, i.e. the size of the image is
  the same. The same can be achieved by adding the <code>angle</code> keyword to an
  orthographic camera. A value for the angle is optional. So this second mode
  is active if no up and right are within the camera statement, or when the
  angle keyword is within the camera statement.</p>

  <p>You should be aware though that the visible parts of the scene change
  when switching from perspective to orthographic view. As long as all objects
  of interest are near the look_at point they'll be still visible if the
  orthographic camera is used. Objects farther away may get out of view while
  nearer objects will stay in view.</p>

  <p>If objects are too close to the camera location they may disappear. 
  Too close here means, behind the orthographic camera projection plane 
  (the plane that goes through the <code>look_at</code> point).</p> 


</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_733"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Fisheye projection</h4>
  <p> This is a spherical projection. The
  viewing angle is specified by the <code>angle</code> keyword. An angle of
  180 degrees creates the &quot;standard&quot; fisheye while an angle of 360
  degrees creates a super-fisheye (&quot;I-see-everything-view&quot;). If you
  use this projection you should get a circular image. If this isn't the
  case, i.e. you get an elliptical image, you should read &quot;Aspect
  Ratio&quot;.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_734"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultra wide angle projection</h4>
  <p>This projection is somewhat
  similar to the fisheye but it projects the image onto a rectangle instead of
  a circle. The viewing angle can be specified using the <code>angle</code>
  keyword.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_735"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Omnimax projection</h4>
  <p>The omnimax projection is a 180 degrees
  fisheye that has a reduced viewing angle in the vertical direction. In
  reality this projection is used to make movies that can be viewed in the
  dome-like Omnimax theaters. The image will look somewhat elliptical. The
  <code>angle</code> keyword isn't used with this projection.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_736"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Panoramic projection</h4>
  <p>This projection is called
  &quot;cylindrical equirectangular projection&quot;. It overcomes the
  degeneration problem of the perspective projection if the viewing angle
  approaches 180 degrees. It uses a type of cylindrical projection to be able
  to use viewing angles larger than 180 degrees with a tolerable
  lateral-stretching distortion. The <code>angle</code> keyword is used to
  determine the viewing angle.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_737"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylindrical projection</h4>
  <p>Using this projection the scene is
  projected onto a cylinder. There are four different types of cylindrical
  projections depending on the orientation of the cylinder and the position of
  the viewpoint. A float value in the range 1 to 4 must follow the <code>
  cylinder</code> keyword. The viewing angle and the length of the <code>
  up</code> or <code>right</code> vector determine the dimensions of the camera
  and the visible image. The camera to use is specified by a number. The types
  are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>vertical cylinder, fixed viewpoint</li>
    <li>horizontal cylinder, fixed viewpoint</li>
    <li>vertical cylinder, viewpoint moves along the cylinder's axis</li>
    <li>horizontal cylinder, viewpoint moves along the cylinder's axis</li>
  </ol>


</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_738"></a>
<h4>6.4.2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Spherical projection</h4>
  <p>Using this projection the scene is  projected onto a sphere.
  <br>Syntax:</p>
<pre>
  camera {
    spherical
    [angle HORIZONTAL [VERTICAL]]
    [CAMERA_ITEMS...]
  }
</pre>
<p>The first value after <code>angle</code> sets the horizontal viewing angle of the
camera. With the optional second value, the vertical viewing angle is set: both in degrees.
If the vertical angle is not specfied, it defaults to half the horizontal angle.</p>
<p>The spherical projection is similar to the fisheye projection, in that the scene
is projected on a sphere. But unlike the fisheye camera, it uses rectangular
coordinates instead of polar coordinates; in this it works the same way
as spherical mapping (map_type 1).</p>
<p>This has a number of uses. Firstly, it allows an image rendered with the
spherical camera to be mapped on a sphere without distortion (with the fisheye
camera, you first have to convert the image from polar to rectangular coordinates
in some image editor). Also, it allows effects such as &quot;environment mapping&quot;,
often used for simulating reflections in scanline renderers.</p>
