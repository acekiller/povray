<h2>1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug Reports</h2>

Before submitting any bug reports, make sure that the bug is not in the list of known bugs 
below. Please remember that the POV-Ray users who provide assistance on our news server are 
volunteers who give their time for free so you can enjoy this program for no charge. Keep this 
in mind when wording your message.
<p>
MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE that the subject of your report isn't already covered in this document. 
Questions that are already answered either in this help file, any README's, installation 
notes, FAQ's, or other files supplied with this program will most likely not get the reply
you expect.

<p>We <b>strongly recommend</b> that you check out the
<a href="http://www.povray.org/search/redirect?VFAQ" target="new" class="ExternalLink">»online version of the POV-Ray VFAQ</a>
before submitting a report. This is also a <a href="povdoc_331.html#target_1628">copy of the VFAQ included in this help file</a>
but we recommend viewing the online version if possible as it's being continually updated.

<h3>1.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature Requests are not bugs</h3>

The above may seem to be an obvious statement, but it's not so obvious that this section is 
unnecessary :(. Numerous people had been sending feature requests to the bug reporting email 
address, and this is in part one of the reasons why we no longer provide email support. If
you  want to request a feature, discuss it in one of the povray.* groups on
<a href="http://www.povray.org/groups.html" target="new" class="ExternalLink">»news.povray.org</a>.

<h3>1.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Known Bugs</h3>

POV-Ray for Unix is currently not handling the POVINI environment variable.  This should be fixed in the near future.

<p>
Other known issues can be found in the <a href="http://www.povray.org/search/redirect?VFAQ" target="new" class="ExternalLink">»POV-Ray VFAQ</a>.
There is a <a href="povdoc_331.html#target_1628">copy of the VFAQ included in this help file</a> but we
recommend viewing the online version if possible as it's being continually updated.

<h3>1.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Spelling</h3>

As stated in the introduction, we use international English spelling in many parts of POV-Ray 
for Unix. This means that many words that are normally spelt with a 'z' in American English 
(such as minimized) are spelt with the English 's' (e.g. minimised). (We have actually received
flame email from folks who told us we couldn't spell).

<h3>1.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug Reporting via Email</h3>

Unfortunately, email bug reporting is no longer available due to the abuse of this facility by 
a number of users. You may only report bugs in POV-Ray by using the newsgroups mentioned in the 
next section.
