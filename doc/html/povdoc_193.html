<h3>6.5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Light Sources</h3>

<a name="target_915"></a>

  <p>The <code>light_source</code> is not really an object. Light sources have
  no visible shape of their own. They are just points or areas which emit
  light. They are categorized as objects so that they can be combined with
  regular objects using <code>union</code>. Their full syntax is:</p>
<pre>
LIGHT_SOURCE:
    light_source
    {
        &lt;Location&gt;, COLOR
        [LIGHT_MODIFIERS...]
    }
LIGHT_MODIFIER:
    LIGHT_TYPE | SPOTLIGHT_ITEM | AREA_LIGHT_ITEMS |
    GENERAL_LIGHT_MODIFIERS
LIGHT_TYPE:
    spotlight | shadowless | cylinder | parallel
SPOTLIGHT_ITEM:
    radius Radius | falloff Falloff | tightness Tightness |
    point_at &lt;Spot&gt;
PARALLEL_ITEM:
    point_at &lt;Spot&gt;
AREA_LIGHT_ITEM:
    area_light &lt;Axis_1&gt;, &lt;Axis_2&gt;, Size_1, Size_2 |
    adaptive Adaptive | jitter Jitter | circular | orient
GENERAL_LIGHT_MODIFIERS:
    looks_like { OBJECT } |
    TRANSFORMATION fade_distance Fade_Distance |
    fade_power Fade_Power | media_attenuation [Bool] |
    media_interaction [Bool] | projected_through
</pre>

<p>
Light source default values:
<a name="target_916"></a>
<pre>
LIGHT_TYPE        : pointlight
falloff           : 70
media_interaction : on
media_attenuation : off
point_at          : &lt;0,0,0&gt;
radius            : 70
tightness         : 10
</pre>
</p>

  <p>The different types of light sources and the optional modifiers are
  described in the following sections.</p><p>
   The first two items are common to all light sources. The <em><code>&lt;Location&gt;</code></em>
  vector gives the location of the light. The <em>COLOR</em> gives the color 
  of the light. Only the red, green, and blue components are significant. Any 
  transmit or filter values are ignored. </p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> you vary the intensity of 
  the light as well as the color using this parameter. A color such as 
  <code>rgb &lt;0.5,0.5,0.5&gt;</code> gives a white light that is half the 
  normal intensity.</p><p> All of the keywords or items in the syntax 
  specification above may appear in any order. Some keywords only have effect 
  if specified with other keywords. The keywords are grouped into functional 
  categories to make it clear which keywords work together. The 
  <em>GENERAL_LIGHT_MODIFIERS</em> work with all types of lights and all 
  options. </p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> that <em>TRANSFORMATIONS</em> such as <code><a href="povdoc_175.html#target_702">translate</a></code>,
  <code><a href="povdoc_175.html#target_704">rotate</a></code> etc. may be applied but no  other <em>OBJECT_MODIFIERS</em>
  may be used.</p><p>
   There are three mutually exclusive light types. If no <em>LIGHT_TYPE</em> is
  specified it is a point light. The other choices are <code> spotlight</code>
  and <code>cylinder</code>.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_917"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Point Lights</h4>

  <p>The simplest kind of light is a point light. A point light source sends
  light of the specified color uniformly in all directions. The default light
  type is a point source. The <em><code>&lt;Location&gt;</code></em> and <em>
  COLOR</em> is all that is required. For example:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;1000,1000,-1000&gt;, rgb &lt;1,0.75,0&gt; //an orange light
  }
</pre>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_918"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotlights</h4>

<a name="target_919"></a>

<a name="target_920"></a>
  <p>Normally light radiates outward equally in all directions from the source.
  However the <code>spotlight</code> keyword can be used to create a cone of
  light that is bright in the center and falls of to darkness in a soft fringe
  effect at the edge.</p><p>
  Although the cone of light fades to soft edges, objects illuminated by
  spotlights still cast hard shadows. The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
SPOTLIGHT_SOURCE:
    light_source
    {
        &lt;Location&gt;, COLOR spotlight
        [LIGHT_MODIFIERS...]
    }
LIGHT_MODIFIER:
    SPOTLIGHT_ITEM | AREA_LIGHT_ITEMS | GENERAL_LIGHT_MODIFIERS
SPOTLIGHT_ITEM:
    radius Radius | falloff Falloff | tightness Tightness |
    point_at &lt;Spot&gt;
</pre>
Default values:
<pre>
  radius:    30 degrees
  falloff:   45 degrees
  tightness:  0
</pre>
<a name="target_921"></a>

<a name="target_922"></a>

  <p>The <code>point_at</code> keyword tells the spotlight to point at a
  particular 3D coordinate. A line from the location of the spotlight to the
  <code>point_at</code> coordinate forms the center line of the cone of light.
  The following illustration will be helpful in understanding how these values
  relate to each other.</p>

   
<center><img src="images/spotgeom.gif" alt="The geometry of a spotlight"><br><font size=-1><cite>The geometry of a spotlight</cite></font></center>


<a name="target_923"></a>

<a name="target_924"></a>
<a name="target_925"></a>
<a name="target_926"></a>
<a name="target_927"></a>
<a name="target_928"></a>

  <p>The <code>falloff</code>, <code>radius</code>, and <code> tightness</code>
  keywords control the way that light tapers off at the edges of the cone.
  These four keywords apply only when the <code> spotlight</code> or <code>
  cylinder</code> keywords are used.</p><p>
  The <code>falloff</code> keyword specifies the overall size of the cone of
  light. This is the point where the light falls off to zero intensity. The
  float value you specify is the angle, in degrees, between the edge of the
  cone and center line. The <code> radius</code> keyword specifies the size of
  the &quot;hot-spot&quot; at the center of the cone of light. The
  &quot;hot-spot&quot; is a brighter cone of light inside the spotlight cone
  and has the same center line. The <code>radius</code> value specifies the
  angle, in degrees, between the edge of this bright, inner cone and the center
  line. The light inside the inner cone is of uniform intensity. The light
  between the inner and outer cones tapers off to zero.</p><p>
  For example, assuming a <code>tightness 0</code>, with <code>radius 10</code> and <code>falloff 20</code> the light
  from the center line out to 10 degrees is full intensity. From 10 to 20
  degrees from the center line the light falls off to zero intensity. At 20
  degrees or greater there is no light.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> if the radius and falloff
  values are close or equal the light intensity drops rapidly and the spotlight
  has a sharp edge.</p>
 <p>
   The values for the <code>radius</code>, and <code>tightness</code> parameters are half the opening angles of the
  corresponding cones, both angles have to be smaller than 90 degrees. The
  light smoothly falls off between the radius and the falloff angle like shown
  in the figures below (as long as the radius angle is not negative).</p>

   
<center><img src="images/fixfallo.gif" alt="Intensity multiplier curve with a fixed falloff angle of 45 degrees"><br><font size=-1><cite>Intensity multiplier curve with a fixed falloff angle of 45 degrees</cite></font></center>

   
<center><img src="images/fixedrad.gif" alt="Intensity multiplier curve with a fixed radius angle of 45 degrees"><br><font size=-1><cite>Intensity multiplier curve with a fixed radius angle of 45 degrees</cite></font></center>


  <p>The <code>tightness</code> keyword is used to specify an <em>
    additional</em> exponential softening of the edges. A value other than 0, will
  affect light within the radius cone as well as light in the falloff cone. 
  The intensity of light at an angle from the center line is given by: 
  <em><code>intensity * cos(angle)tightness</code></em>.
  The default value for tightness is 0. Lower
  tightness values will make the spotlight brighter, making the spot wider and
  the edges sharper. Higher values will dim the spotlight, making the spot
  tighter and the edges softer. Values from 0 to 100 are acceptable.</p>

   
<center><img src="images/diftight.gif" alt="Intensity multiplier curve with fixed angle and falloff angles of 30 and 60 degrees respectively and different tightness values"><br><font size=-1><cite>Intensity multiplier curve with fixed angle and falloff angles of 30 and 60 degrees respectively and different tightness values</cite></font></center>


  <p>You should note from the figures that the radius and falloff angles
  interact with the tightness parameter. To give the tightness value full control
over the spotlight's appearance use radius 0 falloff 90. As you
  can see from the figure below. In that case the falloff angle has no effect
  and the lit area is only determined by the tightness parameter.</p>

   
<center><img src="images/negradli.gif" alt="Intensity multiplier curve with a negative radius angle and different tightness values"><br><font size=-1><cite>Intensity multiplier curve with a negative radius angle and different tightness values</cite></font></center>


  <p>Spotlights may be used anyplace that a normal light source is used. Like
  any light sources, they are invisible. They may also be used in conjunction
  with area lights.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_929"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylindrical Lights</h4>

<a name="target_930"></a>
<a name="target_931"></a>
  <p>The <code>cylinder</code> keyword specifies a cylindrical light source
  that is great for simulating laser beams. Cylindrical light sources work
  pretty much like spotlights except that the light rays are constrained by a
  cylinder and not a cone. The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
CYLINDER_LIGHT_SOURCE:
    light_source
    {
        &lt;Location&gt;, COLOR cylinder
        [LIGHT_MODIFIERS...]
    }
LIGHT_MODIFIER:
    SPOTLIGHT_ITEM | AREA_LIGHT_ITEMS | GENERAL_LIGHT_MODIFIERS
SPOTLIGHT_ITEM:
    radius Radius | falloff Falloff | tightness Tightness |
    point_at &lt;Spot&gt;
</pre>
Default values:
<pre>
  radius:     0.75 degrees
  falloff:    1    degrees
  tightness:  0
</pre>

<p>The <code>point_at</code>, <code>radius</code>, <code>falloff</code> and
  <code>tightness</code> keywords control the same features as with the
  spotlight. See &quot;<a href="#target_918">Spotlights</a>&quot; for details.</p><p>
   You should keep in mind that the cylindrical light source is still a point
  light source. The rays are emitted from one point and are only constraint by
  a cylinder. The light rays are not parallel.</p>


</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_932"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel Lights</h4>
<a name="target_933"></a>

<a name="target_934"></a>

<pre>
syntax:

light_source {
  LOCATION_VECTOR, COLOR
  [LIGHT_SOURCE_ITEMS...]
  parallel
  point_at VECTOR
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>parallel</code> keyword can be used with any type of light source.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> for normal point lights, <code>point_at</code> must come after
<code>parallel</code>.</p>

<p>Parallel lights are useful for simulating very distant light sources, such as
sunlight. As the name suggests, it makes the light rays parallel.</p>
<p>Technically this is done by shooting rays from the closest point on a plane to the
object intersection point. The plane is determined by a perpendicular defined by the
light <code>location</code> and the <code>point_at</code> vector.</p>

<p>Two things must be considered when choosing the light location
(specifically, its distance):</p><ol>
  <li>Any parts of an object &quot;above&quot; the light plane still get illuminated according to
  the light direction, but they will not cast or receive shadows.</li>
  <li><code>fade_distance</code> and <code>fade_power</code> use the light
  <code>location</code> to determine distance for light attenuation, so the attenuation
  still looks like that of a point source.
  <br>Area light also uses the light location in its calculations.</li></ol>


</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_935"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Area Lights</h4>

<a name="target_936"></a>

<a name="target_937"></a>
  <p>Area light sources occupy a finite, one- or two-dimensional area of space.
  They can cast soft shadows because an object can partially block their light.
  Point sources are either totally blocked or not blocked.</p><p>
   The <code>area_light</code> keyword in POV-Ray creates sources that are
  rectangular in shape, sort of like a flat panel light. Rather than performing
  the complex calculations that would be required to model a true area light,
  it is approximated as an array of point light sources spread out over the
  area occupied by the light. The array-effect applies to shadows only. The
  object's illumination is still that of a point source. The intensity of
  each individual point light in the array is dimmed so that the total amount
  of light emitted by the light is equal to the light color specified in the
  declaration. The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
AREA_LIGHT_SOURCE:

  light_source {
    LOCATION_VECTOR, COLOR
    area_light
    AXIS_1_VECTOR, AXIS_2_VECTOR, Size_1, Size_2
    [adaptive Adaptive] [ jitter ]
    [ circular ] [ orient ]
    [ [LIGHT_MODIFIERS...]
  }
</pre>

<p>Any type of light source may be an area light. </p>

<p>The area_light command defines the location, the size and orientation of the area light
 as well as the number of lights in the light source array. The location vector is the
 centre of a rectangle defined by the two vectors <em><code>&lt;Axis_1&gt;</code></em>
 and <em><code>&lt;Axis_2&gt;</code></em>. These specify the lengths and directions 
 of the edges of the light.</p>

   
<center><img src="images/areal.gif" alt="4x4 Area light, location and vectors"><br><font size=-1><cite>4x4 Area light, location and vectors</cite></font></center>


<p>Since the area lights are rectangular in shape these vectors should be perpendicular
 to each other. The larger the size of the light the thicker the soft part of shadows 
 will be. The integers Size_1 and Size_2 specify the number of rows and columns of point
 sources of the. The more lights you use the smoother your shadows will be but the longer
 they will take to render.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> it is possible to specify spotlight parameters along with the area
  light parameters to create area spotlights. Using area spotlights is a good
  way to speed up scenes that use area lights since you can confine the lengthy

  soft shadow calculations to only the parts of your scene that need them.</p><p>
   An interesting effect can be created using a linear light source. Rather
  than having a rectangular shape, a linear light stretches along a line sort
  of like a thin fluorescent tube. To create a linear light just create an area
  light with one of the array dimensions set to 1.</p><p>
<a name="target_938"></a>

<a name="target_939"></a>
<a name="target_940"></a>
   The <code>jitter</code> command is optional. When used it causes the
  positions of the point lights in the array to be randomly jittered to
  eliminate any shadow banding that may occur. The jittering is completely
  random from render to render and should not be used when generating
  animations.</p><p>
<a name="target_941"></a>

<a name="target_942"></a>
   The <code>adaptive</code> command is used to enable adaptive sampling of
  the light source. By default POV-Ray calculates the amount of light that
  reaches a surface from an area light by shooting a test ray at every point
  light within the array. As you can imagine this is very slow. Adaptive
  sampling on the other hand attempts to approximate the same calculation by
  using a minimum number of test rays. The number specified after the keyword
  controls how much adaptive sampling is used. The higher the number the more
  accurate your shadows will be but the longer they will take to render. If
  you're not sure what value to use a good starting point is <code>
  adaptive 1</code>. The <code>adaptive</code> keyword only accepts integer
  values and cannot be set lower than 0.</p><p>
   When performing adaptive sampling POV-Ray starts by shooting a test ray at
  each of the four corners of the area light. If the amount of light received
  from all four corners is approximately the same then the area light is
  assumed to be either fully in view or fully blocked. The light intensity is
  then calculated as the average intensity of the light received from the four
  corners. However, if the light intensity from the four corners differs
  significantly then the area light is partially blocked. The area light is
  split into four quarters and each section is sampled as described above. This
  allows POV-Ray to rapidly approximate how much of the area light is in view
  without having to shoot a test ray at every light in the array. Visually the
  sampling goes like shown below.</p>

   
<center><img src="images/arealigh.gif" alt="Area light adaptive samples"><br><font size=-1><cite>Area light adaptive samples</cite></font></center>


  <p>While the adaptive sampling method is fast (relatively speaking) it can
  sometimes produce inaccurate shadows. The solution is to reduce the amount
  of adaptive sampling without completely turning it off. The number after the
  adaptive keyword adjusts the number of times that the area light will be
  split before the adaptive phase begins. For example if you use <code>
  adaptive 0</code> a minimum of 4 rays will be shot at the light. If you use
  <code> adaptive 1</code> a minimum of 9 rays will be shot (<code>adaptive
  2</code> gives 25 rays, <code>adaptive 3</code> gives 81 rays, etc).
  Obviously the more shadow rays you shoot the slower the rendering will be so
  you should use the lowest value that gives acceptable results.</p><p>
   The number of rays never exceeds the values you specify for rows and columns
  of points. For example <code>area_light x,y,4,4</code> specifies a 4 by 4
  array of lights. If you specify <code>adaptive 3</code> it would mean that
  you should start with a 9 by 9 array. In this case no adaptive sampling is
  done. The 4 by 4 array is used.</p>

<a name="target_943"></a>

<a name="target_944"></a>
  <p>The <code>circular</code> command has been added to area lights in 
  order to better create circular soft shadows. With ordinary area lights the pseudo-lights
are arranged in a rectangular grid and thus project partly rectangular shadows around
all objects, including circular objects.
<br>By including the <code>circular</code> tag in an area light, the light is stretched
and squashed so that it looks like a circle: this way, circular or spherical light sources
are better simulated.</p>
<p>A few things to remember:</p><ul>
  <li>Circular area lights can be ellipses: the AXIS_1_VECTOR and AXIS_2_VECTOR
  define the shape and orientation of the circle; if the vectors are not equal, the light
  source is elliptical in shape.</li>
  <li>Rectangular artefacts may still show up with very large area grids.</li>
  <li>There is no point in using <code>circular</code> with linear area lights or area lights
  which have a  2x2 size.</li>
  <li>The area of a circular light is roughly 78.5 per cent of a similar size rectangular 
  area light.  Increase your axis vectors accordingly if you wish to keep the light source
  area constant.</li></ul>

<a name="target_945"></a>

<a name="target_946"></a>
  <p>The <code>orient</code> command has been added to area lights in order 
  to better create soft shadows. Without this modifier, you have to take care when
choosing the axis vectors of an area_light, since they define both its area and orientation.
<br>Area lights are two dimensional: shadows facing the area light receive light from a
larger surface area than shadows at the sides of the area light.</p>

  
<center><img src="images/area2.gif" alt="Area light facing object"><br><font size=-1><cite>Area light facing object</cite></font></center>


 <p>Actually, the area from which light is emitted at the sides of the area light is reduced to a
single line, only casting soft shadows in one direction.</p>

  
<center><img src="images/area1.gif" alt="Area light not facing object"><br><font size=-1><cite>Area light not facing object</cite></font></center>


<p>Between these two extremes the surface area emitting light progresses gradually.
<br>By including the <code>orient</code> modifier in an area light, the light is rotated
so that for every shadow test, it always faces the point being tested. The initial
orientation is no longer important, so you only have to consider the desired dimensions
(area) of the light source when specifying the axis vectors.
<br>In effect, this makes the area light source appear 3-dimensional (e.g. an area_light
with perpendicular axis vectors of the same size and dimensions using <code>circular</code>
<em>and</em> <code>orient</code> simulates a spherical light source).</p>

<p>Orient has a few restrictions:</p>

<ol>
<li>It can be used with &quot;circular&quot; lights only.</li>
<li>The two axes of the area light must be of equal length.</li>
<li>The two axes of the area light should use an equal number
   of samples, and that number should be greater than one</li>
</ol>
<p>These three rules exist because without them, you can get unpredictable
results from the orient feature.</p>

<p>If one of the first two rules is broken, POV will issue a warning and
correct the problem. If the third rule is broken, you will only get the error message, and POV
will not automatically correct the problem.</p>



</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_947"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadowless Lights</h4>

<a name="target_948"></a>

<a name="target_949"></a>
  <p>Using the <code>shadowless</code> keyword you can stop a light source from
  casting shadows. These lights are sometimes called &quot;fill lights&quot;.
  They are another way to simulate ambient light however shadowless lights have
  a definite source. The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
SHADOWLESS_LIGHT_SOURCE:
    light_source
    {
        &lt;Location&gt;, COLOR shadowless
        [LIGHT_MODIFIERS...]
    }
LIGHT_MODIFIER:
    AREA_LIGHT_ITEMS | GENERAL_LIGHT_MODIFIERS
</pre>

  <p><code>shadowless</code> may be used with all types of light sources.
The only restriction is that <code>shadowless</code> should be before or
after <em>all</em> spotlight or cylinder option keywords. Don't mix or you get
the message &quot;Keyword 'the one following shadowless' cannot be used with
standard light source&quot;. Also note that shadowless lights will not cause
highlights on the illuminated objects.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_950"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks_like</h4>
<a name="target_951"></a>
  <p>Normally the light source itself has no visible shape. The light simply
  radiates from an invisible point or area. You may give a light source any
  shape by adding a <code>looks_like {</code><em> OBJECT</em> <code>}</code>
  statement.</p><p>

   There is an implied <code>no_shadow</code> attached to the <code>
  looks_like</code> object so that light is not blocked by the object. Without
  the automatic <code>no_shadow</code> the light inside the object would not
  escape. The object would, in effect, cast a shadow over everything.</p><p>
   If you want the attached object to block light then you should attach it
  with a <code>union</code> and not a <code>looks_like</code> as follows:</p>
<pre>
  union {
    light_source { &lt;100, 200, -300&gt; color White }
    object { My_Lamp_Shape }
  }
</pre>

  <p>Presumably parts of the lamp shade are transparent to let some light
  out.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_952"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Projected_Through</h4>
<a name="target_953"></a>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    LOCATION_VECTOR, COLOR
    [LIGHT_SOURCE_ITEMS...]
    projected_through { OBJECT }
  }
</pre>

<p>Projected_through can be used with any type of light source. Any object can be
used, provided it has been declared before.
<br>Projecting a light through an object can be thought of as the opposite of
shadowing: only the light rays that hit the projected_through object
will contribute to the scene.
<br>This also works with area_lights, producing spots of light with soft edges.
<br>Any objects between the light and the projected through object will not cast
shadows for this light. Also any surface within the projected through object
will not cast shadows.
<br>Any textures or interiors on the object will be stripped and the object will not
show up in the scene.</p>


</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_954"></a>
<h4>6.5.7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;Light Fading</h4>
<a name="target_955"></a>

<a name="target_956"></a>
<a name="target_957"></a>
  <p>By default POV-Ray does not diminish light from any light source as it
  travels through space. In order to get a more realistic effect <code>
  fade_distance</code> and <code>fade_power</code> keywords followed by float
  values can be used to model the distance based falloff in light
  intensity.</p><p>

<a name="target_958"></a>

  The <code>fade_distance</code> is used to specify the distance at which the 
  full light intensity arrives, i. e. the intensity which was given by the 
  <em>COLOR</em> specification. The actual attenuation is described by the 
  <code>fade_power</code> <em><code> Fade_Power</code></em>, which determines 
  the falloff rate. For example linear or quadratic falloff can be used by 
  setting <code>fade_power</code> to 1 or 2 respectively. The complete 
  formula to calculate the factor by which the light is attenuated is</p>

  <p>You should note two important facts: First, for <em><code>Fade_Distance</code></em>
  larger than one the light intensity at distances smaller than 
  <em><code>Fade_Distance</code></em> actually increases. This is necessary 
  to get the light source color if the distance traveled equals the 
  <em><code>Fade_Distance</code></em>. Second, only light coming directly 
  from light sources is attenuated. Reflected or refracted light is not 
  attenuated by distance.</p>

  <p>By default light sources will interact with an atmosphere added to the
  scene. This behavior can be switched off by using <code>media_interaction off</code>
  inside the light source statement. </p>

<h4>6.5.7.11&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmospheric Attenuation</h4>
<a name="target_965"></a>
<a name="target_966"></a>

  <p>Normally light coming from light sources is not influenced by fog or
  atmospheric media. This can be changed by turning the <code>media_attenuation on</code>
  for a given light source on. All light coming from this light source will now
  be diminished as it travels through the fog or media. This results in an
  distance-based, exponential intensity falloff ruled by the used fog or media.
  If there is no fog or media no change will be seen.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong>in POV-Ray 3.0 this
  feature was turned off and on with the atmospheric_attenuation keyword.</p>
