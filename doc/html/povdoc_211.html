<h3>6.7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Layered Textures</h3>

  <p>It is possible to create a variety of special effects using layered
  textures. A layered texture consists of several textures that are partially
  transparent and are laid one on top of the other to create a more complex
  texture. The different texture layers show through the transparent portions
  to create the appearance of one texture that is a combination of several
  textures.</p><p>
   You create layered textures by listing two or more textures one right after
  the other. The last texture listed will be the top layer, the first one
  listed will be the bottom layer. All textures in a layered texture other than
  the bottom layer should have some transparency. For example:</p>
<pre>
  object {
    My_Object
    texture {T1}  // the bottom layer
    texture {T2}  // a semi-transparent layer
    texture {T3}  // the top semi-transparent layer
  }
</pre>

  <p>In this example T2 shows only where T3 is transparent and T1 shows only
  where T2 and T3 are transparent.</p><p>
   The color of underlying layers is filtered by upper layers but the results
  do not look exactly like a series of transparent surfaces. If you had a stack
  of surfaces with the textures applied to each, the light would be filtered
  twice: once on the way in as the lower layers are illuminated by filtered
  light and once on the way out. Layered textures do not filter the
  illumination on the way in. Other parts of the lighting calculations work
  differently as well. The results look great and allow for fantastic looking
  textures but they are simply different from multiple surfaces. See <code>
  stones.inc</code> in the standard include files directory for some
  magnificent layered textures.</p>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> in versions predating POV-Ray 3.5, <code>filter</code> used to work the same
   as <code>transmit</code> in layered textures. It has been changed to work as filter should. This
   can change the appearance of &quot;pre 3.5&quot; textures a lot. The <code>#version</code>
   directive can be used to get the &quot;pre 3.5&quot; behaviour.</p>
   <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> layered textures must use the <code>texture</code> wrapped around any
  pigment, normal or finish statements. Do not use multiple pigment, normal or
  finish statements without putting them inside the texture statement.</p><p>
   Layered textures may be declared. For example</p>
<pre>
  #declare Layered_Examp =
    texture {T1}
    texture {T2}
    texture {T3}
</pre>

  <p>may be invoked as follows:</p>
<pre>
  object {
    My_Object
    texture {
      Layer_Examp
      // Any pigment, normal or finish here
      // modifies the bottom layer only.
    }
  }
</pre>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> No macros are allowed in layered textures.  The problem is that if a macro would contain a declare the parser could no longer guess that two or more texture identifiers are supposed to belong to the layered texture and not some other declare.</p>

  <p>If you wish to use a layered texture in a block pattern, such as <code>
  checker</code>, <code>hexagon</code>, or <code>brick</code>, or in a <code>
  material_map</code>, you must declare it first and then reference it inside a
  single texture statement. A patterned texture cannot be used as a layer in a
  layered texture however you may use layered textures as any of the textures
  contained within a patterned texture.</p>
