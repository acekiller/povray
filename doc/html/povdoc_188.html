<h3>6.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Finite Patch Primitives</h3>

  <p>There are six totally thin, finite objects which have no well-defined
  inside. They are bicubic patch, disc, smooth triangle, triangle, polygon and
  mesh / mesh2. They may be combined in CSG union but cannot be used in other types of
  CSG (or inside a <code>clipped_by</code> statement). Because these types are
  finite POV-Ray can use automatic bounding on them to speed up rendering time.
  As with all shapes they can be translated, rotated and scaled.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">

<h4>6.5.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Bicubic Patch</h4>

<a name="target_829"></a>

<a name="target_830"></a>

<a name="target_831"></a>
  <p>A <code>bicubic_patch</code> is a 3D curved surface created from a mesh of
  triangles. POV-Ray supports a type of bicubic patch called a <em>Bezier
  patch</em>. A bicubic patch is defined as follows:</p>
<pre>
BICUBIC_PATCH:
    bicubic_patch
    {
        PATCH_ITEMS...
        &lt;Point_1&gt;,&lt;Point_2&gt;,&lt;Point_3&gt;,&lt;Point_4&gt;,
        &lt;Point_5&gt;,&lt;Point_6&gt;,&lt;Point_7&gt;,&lt;Point_8&gt;,
        &lt;Point_9&gt;,&lt;Point_10&gt;,&lt;Point_11&gt;,&lt;Point_12&gt;,
        &lt;Point_13&gt;,&lt;Point_14&gt;,&lt;Point_15&gt;,&lt;Point_16&gt;
        [OBJECT_MODIFIERS...]
    }
PATCH_ITEMS:
    type Patch_Type | u_steps Num_U_Steps | v_steps Num_V_Steps |
    flatness Flatness
</pre>

<p>
Bicubic patch default values:
<a name="target_832"></a>
<pre>
flatness : 0.0
u_steps  : 0
v_steps  : 0
</pre>
</p>

<a name="target_833"></a>

  <p>The keyword <code>type</code> is followed by a float <em><code>
  Patch_Type</code></em> which currently must be either 0 or 1. For type 0 only
  the control points are retained within POV-Ray. This means that a minimal
  amount of memory is needed but POV-Ray will need to perform many extra
  calculations when trying to render the patch. Type 1 preprocesses the patch
  into many subpatches. This results in a significant speedup in rendering at
  the cost of memory.</p><p>
<a name="target_834"></a>

   The four parameters <code>type</code>, <code> flatness</code>, <code>
  u_steps</code> and <code>v_steps</code> may appear in any order. Only
  <code>type</code> is required. They are followed by 16 vectors (4 rows
  of 4) that define the x, y, z coordinates of the 16 control points which
  define the patch. The patch touches the four corner points <em><code>
  &lt;Point_1&gt;</code></em>, <em><code> &lt;Point_4&gt;</code></em>, <em>
  <code>&lt;Point_13&gt;</code></em> and <em> <code>
  &lt;Point_16&gt;</code></em> while the other 12 points pull and stretch the
  patch into shape. The Bezier surface is enclosed by the convex hull formed by
  the 16 control points, this is known as the <em>convex hull property</em>.</p><p>

   The keywords <code>u_steps</code> and <code>v_steps</code> are each followed
  by integer values which tell how many rows and columns of triangles are the
  minimum to use to create the surface, both default to 0. The maximum number of individual pieces
  of the patch that are tested by POV-Ray can be calculated from the following:
  <em>pieces = 2^u_steps * 2^v_steps</em>.</p><p>
   This means that you really should keep <code>u_steps</code> and <code>
  v_steps</code> under 4. Most patches look just fine with <code>u_steps
  3</code> and <code>v_steps 3</code>, which translates to 64 subpatches (128
  smooth triangles).</p><p>

   As POV-Ray processes the Bezier patch it makes a test of the current piece
  of the patch to see if it is flat enough to just pretend it is a rectangle.
  The statement that controls this test is specified with the <code>
  flatness</code> keyword followed by a float. Typical flatness values range
  from 0 to 1 (the lower the slower). The default if none is specified is
  0.0.</p><p>

   If the value for flatness is 0 POV-Ray will always subdivide the patch to
  the extend specified by <code>u_steps</code> and <code>v_steps</code>. If
  flatness is greater than 0 then every time the patch is split, POV-Ray will
  check to see if there is any need to split further.</p><p>
   There are both advantages and disadvantages to using a non-zero flatness.
  The advantages include:</p>

  <p>- If the patch isn't very curved, then this will be detected and
  POV-Ray won't waste a lot of time looking at the wrong pieces.</p><p>
  - If the patch is only highly curved in a couple of places, POV-Ray will keep
  subdividing there and concentrate it's efforts on the hard part.</p>

  <p>The biggest disadvantage is that if POV-Ray stops subdividing at a
  particular level on one part of the patch and at a different level on an
  adjacent part of the patch there is the potential for cracking. This is
  typically visible as spots within the patch where you can see through. How
  bad this appears depends very highly on the angle at which you are viewing
  the patch.</p><p>
  Like triangles, the bicubic patch is not meant to be generated by hand. These
  shapes should be created by a special utility. You may be able to acquire
  utilities to generate these shapes from the same source from which you
  obtained POV-Ray. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
  bicubic_patch {
    type 0
    flatness 0.01
    u_steps 4
    v_steps 4
    &lt;0, 0, 2&gt;, &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;2, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;3, 0,-2&gt;,
    &lt;0, 1  0&gt;, &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;, &lt;2, 1, 0&gt;, &lt;3, 1, 0&gt;,
    &lt;0, 2, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 2, 0&gt;, &lt;2, 2, 0&gt;, &lt;3, 2, 0&gt;,
    &lt;0, 3, 2&gt;, &lt;1, 3, 0&gt;, &lt;2, 3, 0&gt;, &lt;3, 3, -2&gt;
  }
</pre>

  <p>The triangles in a POV-Ray <code>bicubic_patch</code> are automatically
  smoothed using normal interpolation but it is up to the user (or the
  user's utility program) to create control points which smoothly stitch
  together groups of patches.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_835"></a>
<h4>6.5.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Disc</h4>

  <p>Another flat, finite object available with POV-Ray is the <code>
  disc</code>. The disc is infinitely thin, it has no thickness. If you want a
  disc with true thickness you should use a very short cylinder. A disc shape
  may be defined by:</p>
<pre>
DISC:
    disc
    {
        &lt;Center&gt;, &lt;Normal&gt;, Radius [, Hole_Radius]
        [OBJECT_MODIFIERS...]
    }
</pre>

<p>
Disc default values:
<a name="target_836"></a>
<pre>
HOLE RADIUS : 0.0
</pre>
</p>

  <p>The vector <em><code>&lt;Center&gt;</code></em> defines the x, y, z
  coordinates of the center of the disc. The <em><code>
  &lt;Normal&gt;</code></em> vector describes its orientation by describing its
  surface normal vector. This is followed by a float specifying the <em> <code>
  Radius</code></em>. This may be optionally followed by another float
  specifying the radius of a hole to be cut from the center of the disc.</p>

 <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The inside of a disc is the inside of the plane that contains
 the disc.  Also note that it is not constrained by the radius of the disc.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_837"></a>
<h4>6.5.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesh</h4>

  <p>The <code>mesh</code> object can be used to efficiently store large
  numbers of triangles. Its syntax is:</p>
<pre>
MESH:
    mesh
    {
        MESH_TRIANGLE...
        [MESH_MODIFIER...]
    }
MESH_TRIANGLE:
    triangle
    {
        &lt;Corner_1&gt;, &lt;Corner_2&gt;, &lt;Corner_3&gt;
        [uv_vectors &lt;uv_Corner_1&gt;, &lt;uv_Corner_2&gt;, &lt;uv_Corner_3&gt;]
        [MESH_TEXTURE]
    } |
    smooth_triangle
    {
        &lt;Corner_1&gt;, &lt;Normal_1&gt;,
        &lt;Corner_2&gt;, &lt;Normal_2&gt;,
        &lt;Corner_3&gt;, &lt;Normal_3&gt;
        [uv_vectors &lt;uv_Corner_1&gt;, &lt;uv_Corner_2&gt;, &lt;uv_Corner_3&gt;]
        [MESH_TEXTURE]
    }
MESH_TEXTURE:
    texture { TEXTURE_IDENTIFIER }
MESH_MODIFIER:
    inside_vector &lt;direction&gt; | hierarchy [ Boolean ] |
    OBJECT_MODIFIER
</pre>

<p>
Mesh default values:
<a name="target_838"></a>
<pre>
hierarchy : on
</pre>
</p>

  <p>Any number of <code>triangle</code> and/or <code>smooth_triangle</code>
  statements can be used and each of those triangles can be individually
  textured by assigning a texture identifier to it. The texture has to be
  declared before the mesh is parsed. It is not possible to use texture
  definitions inside the triangle or smooth triangle statements. This is a
  restriction that is necessary for an efficient storage of the assigned
  textures. See &quot;<a href="#target_849">Triangle and Smooth Triangle</a>&quot;
  for more information on triangles.</p>
  <p>The <code>mesh</code> object can support <code>uv_mapping</code>. For this, per triangle the keyword
  <code>uv_vectors</code> has to be given, together with three 2D uv-vectors. Each vector specifies a location
  in the xy-plane from which the texture has to be mapped to the matching points of the triangle.
  Also see the section <a href="povdoc_212.html#target_1080">uv_mapping</a>.</p>

  <p>
<a name="target_839"></a>

   The mesh's components are internally bounded by a bounding box hierarchy
  to speed up intersection testing. The bounding hierarchy can be turned off
  with the <code>hierarchy off</code> keyword. This should only be done if
  memory is short or the mesh consists of only a few triangles. The default is
  <code>hierarchy on</code>.</p><p>
   Copies of a mesh object refer to the same triangle data and thus consume
  very little memory. You can easily trace a hundred copies of a 10000 triangle
  mesh without running out of memory (assuming the first mesh fits into
  memory). The mesh object has two advantages over a union of triangles: it
  needs less memory and it is transformed faster. The memory requirements are
  reduced by efficiently storing the triangles vertices and normals. The
  parsing time for transformed meshes is reduced because only the mesh object
  has to be transformed and not every single triangle as it is necessary for
  unions.</p><p>
   The mesh object can currently only include triangle and smooth triangle
  components. That restriction may change, allowing polygonal components, at
  some point in the future.</p>

<h5>6.5.2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Solid Mesh</h5>
<a name="target_841"></a>

<a name="target_842"></a>
  <p>Triangle mesh objects (<code>mesh</code> and <code>mesh2</code>) can now be used in CSG objects such as difference and intersect, because, after adding <code>inside_vector</code>, they do have a defined 'inside'. This will only work for well-behaved meshes, which are completely closed volumes. If meshes have any holes in them, this might work, but the results are not guaranteed.</p>

  <p>To determine if a point is inside a triangle mesh, POV-Ray shoots a ray from the point in some arbitrary direction. If this vector intersects an odd number of triangles, the point is inside the mesh. If it intersects an even number of triangles, the point is outside of the mesh. You can specify the direction of this vector. For example, to use <code>+z</code> as the direction, you would add the following line to the triangle mesh description (following all other mesh data, but before the object modifiers).
<pre>
  inside_vector &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;
</pre>
This change does not have any effect on unions of triangles... these will still be always hollow.</p>

<a name="target_843"></a>
<h4>6.5.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesh2</h4>
<a name="target_844"></a>

<a name="target_845"></a>


  <p>The new mesh syntax is designed for use in conversion from other file formats.</p>

<pre>
  MESH2 :
      mesh2{
        VECTORS...
        LISTS...   |
        INDICES... |
        MESH_MODIFIERS
      }
  VECTORS :
      vertex_vectors 
      {
        number_of_vertices,
        &lt;vertex1&gt;, &lt;vertex2&gt;, ...
      }|
      normal_vectors 
      {
        number_of_normals,
        &lt;normal1&gt;, &lt;normal2&gt;, ...
      }|
      uv_vectors 
      {
        number_of_uv_vectors,
        &lt;uv_vect1&gt;, &lt;uv_vect2&gt;, ...
      }
  LISTS :
      texture_list 
      {
        number_of_textures,
        texture { Texture1 },
        texture { Texture2 }, ...
      }|
  INDICES :
      face_indices 
      {
        number_of_faces,
        &lt;index_a, index_b, index_c&gt; [,texture_index [,
                                    texture_index, texture_index]],
        &lt;index_d, index_e, index_f&gt; [,texture_index [,
                                    texture_index, texture_index]],
        ...
      }|
      normal_indices 
      {
        number_of_faces,
        &lt;index_a, index_b, index_c&gt;,
        &lt;index_d, index_e, index_f&gt;,
        ...
      }|
      uv_indices {
        number_of_faces,

        &lt;index_d, index_e, index_f&gt;,
        ...
      }
  MESH_MODIFIER :
      inside_vector &lt;direction&gt; | object_modifiers
</pre>


<p><code>mesh2</code> has to be specified in the order <em>VECTORS...</em>, <em>LISTS...</em>, <em>INDICES...</em>.
The <code>normal_vectors</code>, <code>uv_vectors</code>, and <code>texture_list</code> sections are optional. 
If the number of normals equals the number of vertices then the normal_indices section is optional and
the indexes from the <code>face_indices</code> section are used instead. Likewise for the <code>uv_indices</code> section.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> that the numbers of uv_indices must equal number of faces.</p>

<p>The indexes are ZERO-BASED! So the first item in each list has an index of zero.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_846"></a>
<h5>6.5.2.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth and Flat triangles in the same mesh</h5>

<p>You can specify both flat and smooth triangles in the same mesh. To do this, specify
the smooth triangles first in the <code>face_indices</code>
section, followed by the flat triangles. Then, specify normal indices (in the 
<code>normal_indices</code> section) for only the
smooth triangles. Any remaining triangles that do not have normal indices associated with
them will be assumed to be flat triangles.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh5">
<a name="target_847"></a>
<h5>6.5.2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesh Triangle Textures</h5>

<p>To specify a texture for an individual mesh triangle, specify a single integer texture
index following the face-index vector for that triangle.</p>

<p>To specify three textures for vertex-texture interpolation, specify three integer
texture indices (separated by commas) following the face-index vector for that triangle.</p>

<p>Vertex-texture interpolation and textures for an individual triangle can be mixed in the same mesh</p>


</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_848"></a>
<h4>6.5.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Polygon</h4>

  <p>The <code>polygon</code> object is useful for creating rectangles, squares
  and other planar shapes with more than three edges. Their syntax is:</p>
<pre>
POLYGON:
    polygon
    {
        Number_Of_Points, &lt;Point_1&gt; &lt;Point_2&gt;... &lt;Point_n&gt;
        [OBJECT_MODIFIER...]
    }
</pre>

  <p>The float <em><code>Number_Of_Points</code></em> tells how many points are
  used to define the polygon. The points <em><code> &lt;Point_1&gt;</code></em>
  through <em><code>&lt;Point_n&gt;</code></em> describe the polygon or
  polygons. A polygon can contain any number of sub-polygons, either
  overlapping or not. In places where an even number of polygons overlaps a
  hole appears. When you repeat the first point of a sub-polygon, it closes it
  and starts a new sub-polygon's point sequence. This means that all points
  of a sub-polygon are different.</p><p>
   If the last sub-polygon is not closed a warning is issued and the program
  automatically closes the polygon. This is useful because polygons imported
  from other programs may not be closed, i.e. their first and last point are
  not the same.</p><p>
   All points of a polygon are three-dimensional vectors that have to lay on
  the same plane. If this is not the case an error occurs. It is common to use
  two-dimensional vectors to describe the polygon. POV-Ray assumes that the z
  value is zero in this case.</p><p>
  A square polygon that matches the default planar image map is simply:</p>
<pre>
  polygon {
    4,
    &lt;0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 1&gt;, &lt;1, 1&gt;, &lt;1, 0&gt;
    texture {
      finish { ambient 1 diffuse 0 }
      pigment { image_map { gif &quot;test.gif&quot;  } }
    }
    //scale and rotate as needed here
  }
</pre>

  <p>The sub-polygon feature can be used to generate complex shapes like the
  letter &quot;P&quot;, where a hole is cut into another polygon:</p>
<pre>
  #declare P = polygon {
    12,
    &lt;0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 6&gt;, &lt;4, 6&gt;, &lt;4, 3&gt;, &lt;1, 3&gt;, &lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;0, 0&gt;, 
    &lt;1, 4&gt;, &lt;1, 5&gt;, &lt;3, 5&gt;, &lt;3, 4&gt;, &lt;1, 4&gt;
  }
</pre>

  <p>The first sub-polygon (on the first line) describes the outer shape of the
  letter &quot;P&quot;. The second sub-polygon (on the second line) describes
  the rectangular hole that is cut in the top of the letter &quot;P&quot;. Both
  rectangles are closed, i.e. their first and last points are the same.</p><p>
   The feature of cutting holes into a polygon is based on the polygon
  inside/outside test used. A point is considered to be inside a polygon if a
  straight line drawn from this point in an arbitrary direction crosses an odd
  number of edges (this is known as <em>Jordan's curve theorem</em>).</p><p>
  Another very complex example showing one large triangle with three small
  holes and three separate, small triangles is given below:</p>
<pre>
  polygon {
    28,
    &lt;0, 0&gt; &lt;1, 0&gt; &lt;0, 1&gt; &lt;0, 0&gt;          // large outer triangle
    &lt;.3, .7&gt; &lt;.4, .7&gt; &lt;.3, .8&gt; &lt;.3, .7&gt;  // small outer triangle #1
    &lt;.5, .5&gt; &lt;.6, .5&gt; &lt;.5, .6&gt; &lt;.5, .5&gt;  // small outer triangle #2
    &lt;.7, .3&gt; &lt;.8, .3&gt; &lt;.7, .4&gt; &lt;.7, .3&gt;  // small outer triangle #3
    &lt;.5, .2&gt; &lt;.6, .2&gt; &lt;.5, .3&gt; &lt;.5, .2&gt;  // inner triangle #1
    &lt;.2, .5&gt; &lt;.3, .5&gt; &lt;.2, .6&gt; &lt;.2, .5&gt;  // inner triangle #2
    &lt;.1, .1&gt; &lt;.2, .1&gt; &lt;.1, .2&gt; &lt;.1, .1&gt;  // inner triangle #3
  }
</pre>

</div>

<h4>6.5.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Triangle and Smooth Triangle</h4>

<a name="target_850"></a>

  <p>The <code>triangle</code> primitive is available in order to make more
  complex objects than the built-in shapes will permit. Triangles are usually
  not created by hand but are converted from other files or generated by
  utilities. A triangle is defined by</p>
<pre>
TRIANGLE:
    triangle
    {
        &lt;Corner_1&gt;, &lt;Corner_2&gt;, &lt;Corner_3&gt;
        [OBJECT_MODIFIER...]
    }
</pre>

  <p>where <em><code>&lt;Corner_n&gt;</code></em> is a vector defining the x,
  y, z coordinates of each corner of the triangle.</p><p>
   Because triangles are perfectly flat surfaces it would require extremely
  large numbers of very small triangles to approximate a smooth, curved
  surface. However much of our perception of smooth surfaces is dependent upon
  the way light and shading is done. By artificially modifying the surface
  normals we can simulate a smooth surface and hide the sharp-edged seams
  between individual triangles.</p><p>
   The <code>smooth_triangle</code> primitive is used for just such purposes.
  The smooth triangles use a formula called Phong normal interpolation to
  calculate the surface normal for any point on the triangle based on normal
  vectors which you define for the three corners. This makes the triangle
  appear to be a smooth curved surface. A smooth triangle is defined by</p>
<pre>
SMOOTH_TRIANGLE:
    smooth_triangle
    {
        &lt;Corner_1&gt;, &lt;Normal_1&gt;, &lt;Corner_2&gt;,
        &lt;Normal_2&gt;, &lt;Corner_3&gt;, &lt;Normal_3&gt;
        [OBJECT_MODIFIER...]
    }
</pre>

  <p>where the corners are defined as in regular triangles and <em><code>
  &lt;Normal_n&gt;</code></em> is a vector describing the direction of the
  surface normal at each corner.</p><p>
   These normal vectors are prohibitively difficult to compute by hand.
  Therefore smooth triangles are almost always generated by utility programs.
  To achieve smooth results, any triangles which share a common vertex should
  have the same normal vector at that vertex. Generally the smoothed normal
  should be the average of all the actual normals of the triangles which share
  that point.</p><p>
   The <code> mesh</code> object is a way to combine many <code>triangle</code>
  and <code>smooth_triangle</code> objects together in a very efficient way.
  See &quot;<a href="#target_837">Mesh</a>&quot; for details.</p>
