<h3>9.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I increase rendering speed?</h3>

<p>This question can be divided into 2 questions:

</p><p>1) What kind of hardware should I use to increase rendering speed?

</p><p>(Answer by Ken Tyler)

</p><p>The truth is the computations needed for rendering images are both
complex and time consuming. This is one of the few program types
that will actualy put your processors FPU to maximum use.

</p><p>The things that will most improve speed, roughly in order of
appearance, are:

<ol>
<li> CPU speed</li>

<li> FPU speed</li>

<li> Buss speed and level one and two memory cache - More is better.
    The faster the buss speed the faster the processor can swap out
    computations into it's level 2 cache and then read them back in.
    Buss speed therefore can have a large impact on both FPU and
    CPU calculation times. The more cache memory you have available
    the faster the operation becomes because the CPU doesn't have
    to rely on the much slower system RAM to store information in.</li>

<li> Memory amount, type, and speed. Faster and more is undoubtably
    better. Swapping out to the hard drive for increasing memory
    should be considered the last possible option for increasing
    system memory. The speed of the read/write to disk operation
    is like walking compared to driving a car. Here again is were
    buss speed is a major player in the fast rendering game.</li>

<li> Your OS and number of applications open. Closing open applications,
    including background items like system monitor, task scheduler,
    internet connections, windows volume control, and all other
    applications people have hiding in the background, can greatly
    increase rendering time by stealing cpu cycles. Open task manager
    and see what you have open and then close everything but the
    absolute necessities. Other multi-tasking OS's have other methods
    of determining open application and should be used accordingly.</li>

<li> And lastly your graphics card. This may seem unlikely to you
    but it's true. If you have a simple 16 bit graphics card your
    render times, compared to other systems with the same processor
    and memory but better CG cards, will be equal. No more no less.
    If you play a lot of games or watch a lot of mpeg movies on your
    system then by all means own a good CG card. If it's rendering
    and raytracing you want to do then invest in the best system
    speed and architecture your money can buy. The graphics cards
    with hardware acceleration are designed to support fast shading
    of simple polygons, prevalent in the gaming industry, and offer
    no support for the intense mathematical number crunching that
    goes on inside a rendering/raytracing program like Pov-Ray,
    Studio Max, and Lightwave. If your modeling program uses OpenGl
    shading methods then a CG card with support for OpenGL will help
    increase the speed of updating the shading window but when it
    comes time to render or raytrace the image it's support
    dissapears.</li>
</ol>

</p><p>2) How should I make the POV-Ray scenes so that they will render as fast
as possible?

</p><p>These are some things which may speed up rendering without having to
compromise the quality of the scene:

<ul>
<li>Bounding boxes: Sometimes POV-Ray's automatic bounding is not perfect and
    considerable speed may be achieved by bounding objects by hand. These kind
    of objects are, for example, CSG differences and intersections, blobs
    and poly objects. See also:
<a href="povdoc_356.html#target_1678">CSG speed</a>.</li>
<li>Number of light sources: Each light source slows down the rendering. If
    your scene has many light sources, perhaps you should see if you can
    remove some of them without loosing much quality. Also replace point
    light sources with spotlights whenever possible. If a light source only
    lights a little part of the scene, a spotlight is better than a point
    light, since the point light is tested for each pixel while the spotlight
    is only tested when the pixel falls into the cone of the light.</li>
<li>Area lights are very slow to calculate. If you have big media effects,
    they are <i>extremely</i> slow to calculate. Use as few area lights as
    possible. Always use adaptive area lights unless you need very high
    accuracy. Use spot area lights whenever possible.</li>
<li>When you have many objects with the same texture, union them and apply
    the texture only once. This will decrease parse time and memory use.
    (Of course supposing that it doesn't matter if the texture doesn't move
    with the object anymore...)</li>
<li>Things to do when doing fast test renderings:
  <ul>
  <li>Use the quality command line parameter (ie. <code>+Q</code>).</li>
  <li>Comment out (or enclose with <code>#if</code>-statements) the majority
      of the light
      sources and leave only the necessary ones to see the scene.</li>
  <li>Replace (with <code>#if</code>-statements) slow objects (such as
      superellipsoids) with faster ones (such as boxes).</li>
  <li>Replace complex textures with simpler ones (like uniform colors). You
      can also use the <code>quick_color</code> statement to do this (it
      will work when
      you render with quality 5 or lower, ie. command line parameter
      <code>+Q5</code>).</li>
  <li>Reflection and refraction: When an object reflects and refracts light
      (such as a glass object) it usually slows down the rendering
      considerably. For test renderings turning off one of them (reflection
      or refraction) or both should greatly increase rendering speed. For
      example, while testing glass objects it's usually enough to test the
      refraction only and add the reflection only to the final rendering.
      (The problem with both reflecting and refracting objects is that the
      rays will bounce inside the object until max_trace_level is reached,
      and this is very slow.)</li>
  <li>If you have reflection/refraction and a very high
      <code>max_trace_level</code>,
      try setting the adc_bailout value to something bigger than the
      default 1/256.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
