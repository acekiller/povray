<h3>4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p>A raytracer made with POV-Ray sounds really weird, doesn't it? What is it
anyways? POV-Ray is already a raytracer in itself, how can we use it
to make a raytracer? What the...?</p>

<p>The idea is to make a simple sphere raytracer which supports colored spheres
(with diffuse and specular lighting), colored light sources, reflections
and shadows with the POV-Ray SDL (Scene Description Language), then just
render the image created this way. That is, we do not use POV-Ray itself
to raytrace the spheres, but we make our own raytracer with its SDL and use
POV-Ray's raytracing part to just get the image on screen.</p>

<p>What obscure idea could be behind this weirdness (besides a very serious
case of YHBRFTLW...)? Why don't just use POV-Ray itself to raytrace the
spheres a lot faster and that's it?</p>

<p>The idea is not speed nor quality, but to show the power of the POV-Ray SDL.
If you know how to make such a thing as a raytracer with it, we can really
grasp the expressive power of the SDL.</p>

<p>The idea of this document is to make a different approach to POV-Ray SDL
teaching. It's intended to be a different type of tutorial: Instead of
starting from the basics and give simple and dumb examples, we jump right
into a high-end SDL code and see how it is done. However, this is done
in a way that even beginners can learn something from it.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that you'll learn how a simple sphere raytracer is
done by reading this tutorial. There are lots of misconceptions about
raytracing out there, and knowing how to make one helps clear most of them.</p>

<p>Although this tutorial tries to start from basics, it will go quite
fast to very &quot;high-end&quot; scripting, so it might not be the best tutorial
to read for a completely new user, but it should be enough to have some basic
knowledge. Also more advanced users may get some new info from it.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> in some places some mathematics is needed, so you'd better not
be afraid of math.</p>

<p>If some specific POV-Ray SDL syntax is unclear you should consult the
POV-Ray documentation for more help. This tutorial explains how they can
be used, not so much what's their syntax.</p>
