<h3>3.9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishes</h3>

  <p>The final part of a POV-Ray texture is the <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1035">finish</a></code>. It
  controls the properties of the surface of an object. It can make it shiny and
  reflective, or dull and flat. It can also specify what happens to light that
  passes through transparent pigments, what happens to light that is scattered
  by less-than-perfectly-smooth surfaces and what happens to light that is
  reflected by surfaces with thin-film interference properties. There are
  twelve different properties available in POV-Ray to specify the finish of a
  given object. These are controlled by the following keywords: <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1036">ambient</a></code>,
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1038">diffuse</a></code>, <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1039">brilliance</a></code>,
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1044">phong</a></code>, <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1046">specular</a></code>,
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1049">metallic</a></code>, <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1052">reflection</a></code>,
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1041">crand</a></code> and <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1065">iridescence</a></code>.
  Let's design a couple of textures that make use of these parameters.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_197"></a>
<h4>3.9.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Ambient</h4>

  <p>Since objects in POV-Ray are illuminated by light sources, the portions of
  those objects that are in shadow would be completely black were it not for
  the first two finish properties, <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1036">ambient</a></code> and
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1038">diffuse</a></code>. Ambient is used to simulate the light that is scattered
  around the scene that does not come directly from a light source. Diffuse
  determines how much of the light that is seen comes directly from a light
  source. These two keywords work together to control the simulation of ambient
  light. Let's use our gray sphere to demonstrate this. Let's also
  change our plane back to its original green and white checkered pattern.</p>
<pre>
  plane {
    y, -1.5
    pigment {checker Green, White}
  }
  sphere {
    &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
    pigment { Gray75 }
    finish {
      ambient .2
      diffuse .6
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>In the above example, the default values for ambient and diffuse are used.
  We render this to see what the effect is and then make the following change
  to the finish.</p>
<pre>
  ambient 0
  diffuse 0
</pre>

  <p>The sphere is black because we have specified that none of the light
  coming from any light source will be reflected by the sphere. Let's
  change <code>diffuse</code> back to the default of 0.6.</p><p>
   Now we see the gray surface color where the light from the light source
  falls directly on the sphere but the shaded side is still absolutely black.
  Now let's change <code>diffuse</code> to 0.3 and <code>ambient</code> to
  0.3.</p><p>
   The sphere now looks almost flat. This is because we have specified a fairly
  high degree of ambient light and only a low amount of the light coming from
  the light source is diffusely reflected towards the camera. The default
  values of <code> ambient</code> and <code>diffuse</code> are pretty good
  averages and a good starting point. In most cases, an ambient value of 0.1
  ... 0.2 is sufficient and a diffuse value of 0.5 ... 0.7 will usually do the
  job. There are a couple of exceptions. If we have a completely transparent
  surface with high refractive and/or reflective values, low values of both
  ambient and diffuse may be best. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
sphere {
   &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
   pigment { White filter 1 }
   finish {
      ambient 0
      diffuse 0
      reflection .25
      specular 1
      roughness .001
   }
   interior { ior 1.33 }
}
</pre>

  <p>This is glass, obviously. Glass is a material that takes nearly all of its
  appearance from its surroundings. Very little of the surface is seen because
  it transmits or reflects practically all of the light that shines on it. See
  <code>glass.inc</code> for some other examples.</p><p>
   If we ever need an object to be completely illuminated independently of the
  lighting situation in a given scene we can do this artificially by specifying
  an <code>ambient</code> value of 1 and a <code>diffuse</code> value of 0.
  This will eliminate all shading and simply give the object its fullest and
  brightest color value at all points. This is good for simulating objects that
  emit light like light bulbs and for skies in scenes where the sky may not be
  adequately lit by any other means.</p><p>
   Let's try this with our sphere now.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { White }
     finish {
        ambient 1
        diffuse 0
     }
  }
</pre>

  <p>Rendering this we get a blinding white sphere with no visible highlights
  or shaded parts. It would make a pretty good streetlight.</p>

</div>

<h4>3.9.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Surface Highlights</h4>
<a name="target_199"></a>
<a name="target_200"></a>

  <p>In the glass example above, we noticed that there were bright little <em>
  hotspots</em> on the surface. This gave the sphere a hard, shiny appearance.
  POV-Ray gives us two ways to specify surface specular highlights. The first
  is called <em>Phong highlighting.</em> Usually, Phong highlights are
  described using two keywords: <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1044">phong</a></code> and
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1044">phong_size</a></code>. The float that follows
  <code>phong</code> determines the brightness of the highlight while the float
  following <code>phong_size</code> determines its size. Let's try this.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
    pigment { Gray50 }
    finish {
      ambient .2
      diffuse .6
      phong .75
      phong_size 25
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>Rendering this we see a fairly broad, soft highlight that gives the sphere
  a kind of plastic appearance. Now let's change <code> phong_size</code>
  to 150. This makes a much smaller highlight which gives the sphere the
  appearance of being much harder and shinier.</p><p>
   There is another kind of highlight that is calculated by a different means
  called <em>specular highlighting</em>. It is specified using the keyword
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1046">specular</a></code> and operates in conjunction with another keyword
  called <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1047">roughness</a></code>. These two keywords work together in much the
  same way as <code>phong</code> and <code>phong_size</code> to create
  highlights that alter the apparent shininess of the surface. Let's try
  using specular in our sphere.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { Gray50 }
     finish {
        ambient .2
        diffuse .6
        specular .75
        roughness .1
    }
  }
</pre>

  <p>Looking at the result we see a broad, soft highlight similar to what we
  had when we used <code>phong_size</code> of 25. Change <code>roughness</code>
  to .001 and render again. Now we see a small, tight highlight similar to what
  we had when we used <code>phong_size</code> of 150. Generally speaking, specular
  is slightly more accurate and therefore slightly more realistic than phong but
  you should try both methods when designing a texture. There are even times when
  both phong and specular may be used on a finish.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_201"></a>
<h4>3.9.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Reflection, Metallic and Metallic</h4>
<a name="target_202"></a>

  <p>There is another surface parameter that goes hand in hand with highlights,
  <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1052">reflection</a></code>. Surfaces that are very shiny usually have a degree
  of reflection to them. Let's take a look at an example.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { Gray50 }
     finish {
        ambient .2
        diffuse .6
        specular .75
        roughness .001
        reflection {
           .5
        }
     }
  }
</pre>

  <p>We see that our sphere now reflects the green and white checkered plane
  and the black background but the gray color of the sphere seems out of place.
  This is another time when a lower diffuse value is needed. Generally, the
  higher <code>reflection</code> is the lower <code>diffuse</code> should be.
  We lower the diffuse value to 0.3 and the ambient value to 0.1 and render
  again. That is much better. Let's make our sphere as shiny as a polished
  gold ball bearing.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { BrightGold }
     finish {
        ambient .1
        diffuse .1
        specular 1
        roughness .001
        reflection {
           .75
        }
     }
   }
</pre>

  <p>That is close but there is something wrong, the colour of the reflection and the highlight. To
  make the surface appear more like metal the keyword <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1049">metallic</a></code>
  is used. We add it now to see the difference.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { BrightGold }
     finish {
        ambient .1
        diffuse .1
        specular 1
        roughness .001
        reflection {
          .75
          metallic
        }
     }
  }
</pre>
<p>The reflection has now more of the gold color than the color of its enviroment. Last detail, 
the highlight. We add another metallic statement, now to the finish and not inside the reflection 
block.</p> 
<pre>
  sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { BrightGold }
     finish {
        ambient .1
        diffuse .1
        specular 1
        roughness .001
        metallic
        reflection {
          .75
          metallic
        }
     }
  }
</pre>
  <p>We see that the highlight has taken on the color of the surface rather
  than the light source. This gives the surface a more metallic appearance.</p>

<h4>3.9.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Iridescence</h4>

  <p><em>Iridescence</em> is what we see on the surface of an oil slick when
  the sun shines on it. The rainbow effect is created by something called
  <em>thin-film interference</em> (read section &quot;<a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1065">Iridescence</a>&quot; for
  details). For now let's just try using it. Iridescence is specified by
  the <code><a href="povdoc_208.html#target_1066">irid</a></code> statement and three values: amount,
  <code>thickness</code> and <code>turbulence</code>. The amount is the contribution
  to the overall surface color. Usually 0.1 to 0.5 is sufficient here.
  The thickness affects the &quot;busyness&quot; of the effect. Keep this between
  0.25 and 1 for best results. The turbulence is a little different from
  pigment or normal turbulence. We cannot set <code>octaves</code>, <code>lambda</code>
  or <code>omega</code> but we can specify an amount which will affect the thickness
  in a slightly different way from the thickness value. Values between 0.25 and 1
  work best here too. Finally, iridescence will respond to the surface normal since
  it depends on the angle of incidence of the light rays striking the surface.
  With all of this in mind, let's add some iridescence to our glass sphere.</p>
<pre>
sphere {
     &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { White filter 1 }
     finish {
        ambient .1
        diffuse .1
        reflection .2
        specular 1
        roughness .001
        irid {
          0.35
          thickness .5
          turbulence .5
        }
     }
     interior{
        ior 1.5
        fade_distance 5
        fade_power 1
        caustics 1
     }
}
</pre>

  <p>We try to vary the values for amount, thickness and turbulence to see what
  changes they make. We also try to add a <code>normal</code> block to see what
  happens.</p>
