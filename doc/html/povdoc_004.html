<h3>1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Who Can Use POV-Ray for Unix?</h3>

Almost anyone can use POV-Ray for Unix. If you have never seen a ray tracing program 
before, you can have great fun just rendering the sample scenes and animations installed 
together with POV-Ray for Unix. Once you have studied some scene files and spent a little 
bit of time reading this documentation, you can start putting basic scene files together.
<p>
Remember, though, that you do need to invest some time getting to know the program. For 
instance, you do not have to worry about most of the POV-Ray settings at first, but some of 
them are critical. Ignore them and POV-Ray for Unix may not do what you expect. The default 
settings have been selected so as to be satisfactory in the large majority of cases, but 
sometimes they will not give you what you want. Don't give up. The solution is bound to be a 
simple one, as long as you take the time to read the documentation. Investing a little bit of 
time getting to know the program will pay off - guaranteed!
<p>
As for experienced POV-Ray users, you will find that running POV-Ray in a Unix environment
makes life much easier.  Working under Unix means you can use editors and other powerful tools
with which you may already be quite familiar.  POV-Ray modes exist for popular text editors
such as Emacs, and these provide many of the features found in the POV-Ray GUI interface on
other platforms.

<h3>1.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Spelling</h3>

Some US Residents have commented on the spelling of some words such as colour, initialisation, 
and minimised (they expect color, initialization, or minimized). POV-Ray is an international 
effort and as such our spelling sometimes conforms to British, European, or Australian, rather 
than American, English. You'll find examples of this both in this document and in POV-Ray 
itself (for example, POV accepts both 'color' and 'colour' as valid keywords).
