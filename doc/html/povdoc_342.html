<h3>9.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there no converters from POV to other formats?</h3>

<p><i>&quot;Why are there so many converters from other 3D file formats to POV, but
practically no converters from POV to other formats?&quot;</i>

</p><p>It's a mistake to think that a POV-Ray file is just the
same kind of data file as in most other renderers.

</p><p>The file format of most renderers is just a data file
containing numerical values (vertex coordinates, triangle indices,
textures, uv-coordinates, NURBS data...) describing the scene.
They usually are very little more than just numerical data containers.

</p><p>However, POV-Ray files are much more than just data files.
POV-Ray files are actually source code of the POV-Ray scripting language.
The POV-Ray scripting language is by many means a full programming language
(it's Turing-strong). It contains many features typical to programming
languages and non-typical to data files (such as variables, loops, mathematical
functions, macros, etc). It has many features to describe things in a much
more abstract way than just plain numbers.

</p><p>This is why converting a POV-file to a data file readable
by other renderers is so difficult. The converter program would actually
have to &quot;execute&quot;, that is, interpret the scripting language (in the exact
same way as a BASIC or Perl source code is interpreted). Making a scripting
language interpreter is a much more laborious job than just converting
numerical data from one format to another.

</p><p>There's also another problem: POV-Ray describes most of its
objects as mathematical entities while most of other renderers just handle
triangles (or NURBS or similar easily tesselable primitives). A converter
would have to make some tesselation in order to convert most POV-Ray
primitives to other formats. This can be a quite laborious job for a
converter to make (it would have to practically implement an almost
fully-qualified POV-Ray renderer).

</p><p>This is why making a full-featured converter from any
POV-file to any other format is an almost impossible task.
