<h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Ray-Tracing?</h2>

  <p>Ray-tracing is a rendering technique that calculates an image of a scene
  by simulating the way rays of light travel in the real world. However it does
  its job backwards. In the real world, rays of light are emitted from a light
  source and illuminate objects. The light reflects off of the objects or
  passes through transparent objects. This reflected light hits our eyes or
  perhaps a camera lens. Because the vast majority of rays never hit an
  observer, it would take forever to trace a scene.</p><p>
   Ray-tracing programs like POV-Ray start with their simulated camera and
  trace rays backwards out into the scene. The user specifies the location of
  the camera, light sources, and objects as well as the surface texture
  properties of objects, their interiors (if transparent) and any atmospheric
  media such as fog, haze, or fire.</p><p>
   For every pixel in the final image one or more viewing rays are shot from
  the camera, into the scene to see if it intersects with any of the objects in
  the scene. These &quot;viewing rays&quot; originate from the viewer,
  represented by the camera, and pass through the viewing window (representing
  the final image).</p><p>
   Every time an object is hit, the color of the surface at that point is
  calculated. For this purpose rays are sent backwards to each light source to
  determine the amount of light coming from the source. These &quot;shadow
  rays&quot; are tested to tell whether the surface point lies in shadow or
  not. If the surface is reflective or transparent new rays are set up and
  traced in order to determine the contribution of the reflected and refracted
  light to the final surface color.</p><p>
   Special features like inter-diffuse reflection (radiosity), atmospheric
  effects and area lights make it necessary to shoot a lot of additional rays
  into the scene for every pixel.</p>
