<h3>6.8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Media Types</h3>

  <p>There are three types of particle interaction in <code>media</code>:
  absorbing, emitting, and scattering. All three activities may occur in a
  single media. Each of these three specifications requires a color. Only the
  red, green, and blue components of the color are used. The filter and
  transmit values are ignored. For this reason it is permissible to use one
  float value to specify an intensity of white color. For example the following
  two lines are legal and produce the same results:</p>
<pre>
  emission 0.75
  emission rgb&lt;0.75,0.75,0.75&gt;
</pre>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1189"></a>
<h4>6.8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Absorption</h4>

  <p>The <code>absorption</code> keyword specifies a color of light which is
  absorbed when looking through the media. For example <code>absorption
  rgb&lt;0,1,0&gt;</code> blocks the green light but permits red and blue to
  get through. Therefore a white object behind the media will appear
  magenta.</p><p>
  The default value is <code>rgb&lt;0,0,0&gt;</code> which means no light is
  absorbed -- all light passes through normally.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1190"></a>
<h4>6.8.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Emission</h4>

  <p>The <code>emission</code> keyword specifies a color of the light emitted
  from the particles. Although we say they &quot;emit&quot; light, this only
  means that they are visible without any illumination shining on them. They do
  not really emit light that is cast on to nearby objects. This is similar to
  an object with high <code>ambient</code> values. The default value is <code>
  rgb&lt;0,0,0&gt;</code> which means no light is emitted.</p>

</div>

<div class="divh4">
<a name="target_1191"></a>
<h4>6.8.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattering</h4>

  <p>The syntax of a <code>scattering</code> statement is:</p>
<pre>
SCATTERING:
    scattering { 
        Type, COLOR [ eccentricity Value ] [ extinction Value ] 
    }
</pre>

  <p>The first float value specifies the type of scattering. This is followed
  by the color of the scattered light. The default value if no <code>
  scattering</code> statement is given is <code>rgb&lt;0,0,0&gt;</code> which
  means no scattering occurs.</p><p>
<a name="target_1192"></a>

   The scattering effect is only visible when light is shining on the media
  from a light source. This is similar to <code>diffuse</code> reflection off
  of an object. In addition to reflecting light, a scattering media also
  absorbs light like an <code> absorption</code> media. The balance between how
  much absorption occurs for a given amount of scattering is controlled by the
  optional <code> extinction</code> keyword and a single float value. The
  default value of 1.0 gives an extinction effect that matches the scattering.
  Values such as <code>extinction 0.25</code> give 25% the normal amount. Using
  <code> extinction 0.0</code> turns it off completely. Any value other than
  the 1.0 default is contrary to the real physical model but decreasing
  extinction can give you more artistic flexibility.</p><p>
   The integer value <em><code> Type</code></em> specifies one of five
  different scattering phase functions representing the different models:
  isotropic, Mie (haze and murky atmosphere), Rayleigh, and
  Henyey-Greenstein.</p><p>
  Type 1, <em>isotropic scattering</em> is the simplest form of scattering
  because it is independent of direction. The amount of light scattered by
  particles in the atmosphere does not depend on the angle between the viewing
  direction and the incoming light.</p><p>
   Types 2 and 3 are <em>Mie haze</em> and <em>Mie murky</em> scattering which
  are used for relatively small particles such as minuscule water droplets of
  fog, cloud particles, and particles responsible for the polluted sky. In this
  model the scattering is extremely directional in the forward direction i.e.
  the amount of scattered light is largest when the incident light is
  anti-parallel to the viewing direction (the light goes directly to the
  viewer). It is smallest when the incident light is parallel to the viewing
  direction. The haze and murky atmosphere models differ in their scattering
  characteristics. The murky model is much more directional than the haze
  model.</p>

  <p>Type 4 <em>Rayleigh scattering</em> models the scattering for extremely
  small particles such as molecules of the air. The amount of scattered light
  depends on the incident light angle. It is largest when the incident light is
  parallel or anti-parallel to the viewing direction and smallest when the
  incident light is perpendicular to the viewing direction. You should note
  that the Rayleigh model used in POV-Ray does not take the dependency of
  scattering on the wavelength into account.</p>

<a name="target_1193"></a>

  <p>Type 5 is the <em>Henyey-Greenstein scattering</em> model. It is based on
  an analytical function and can be used to model a large variety of different
  scattering types. The function models an ellipse with a given eccentricity e.
  This eccentricity is specified by the optional keyword <code>
  eccentricity</code> which is only used for scattering type five. The default
  eccentricity value of zero defines isotropic scattering while positive values
  lead to scattering in the direction of the light and negative values lead to
  scattering in the opposite direction of the light. Larger values of e (or
  smaller values in the negative case) increase the directional property of the
  scattering.</p>
