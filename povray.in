;
;  The general form of the options is "Variable=value".  Everything 
;  between the equals sign and the end of the line is considered part 
;  of the value.  The spacing and layout is free-form but only one option 
;  per line is allowed.  Variables and values are not case-sensitive.  
;
;  Note: characters after a semi-colon are treated as a comment
;
;  Traditional POV-Ray switches beginning with + or - are also allowed
;  and they may be given with more than one switch per line.  
;
;  These options have been put in this file because they will help
;  you get up and running quickly.  This file assumes you have installed
;  the program in the C:\POVRAY3 drive and directory.  If you have
;  installed the program on a different drive or directory you must edit
;  the appropriate lines below.  See the general documentation for full
;  instructions on how to use INI options.
