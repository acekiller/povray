                  Persistence of Vision Raytracer
                           Version 2.0
                        Basic Information
                  -------------------------------

    The Persistence of Vision Raytracer creates three-dimensional,
photo-realistic images using a rendering technique called ray tracing.
It reads in a text file containing information describing the objects and
lighting in a scene and generates an image of that scene from the view
point of a camera also described in the text file. Ray tracing is not
a fast process by any means, but it produces very high quality images
with realistic reflections, shading, perspective, and other effects.

   The POV-Ray package includes detailed instructions on using the
raytracer and creating scenes. Many stunning scenes are included with
POV-Ray so you can start creating images immediately when you get
the package. These scenes can be modified by the user also so they
don't have to start from scratch.

   In addition to the pre-defined scenes are a large library of
predefined shapes and materials that can be used in your own scenes by
just typing the name of the shape or material.

   POV-Ray is easy to use, and also includes many advanced features
like bezier patches, blobs, height-fields, bump mapping, and material
mapping.

   POV-Ray can be used on IBM-PC and compatibles, Apple Macintoshes,
Commodore Amiga's, UNIX, and other computers.

   Here is a list the files that you need to use POV-Ray on your
computer.

The latest versions of these files are available over CompuServe,
America Online, Internet, and several BBS's. See 'Where to find POV-Ray
files' section below for more info.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     For IBM-PC & compatibles:
     -------------------------
        Requires: 386 or better CPU and at least 2 meg of RAM
                  A math co-processor and VGA display is recommended
                  This version will run under DOS, OS/2 and Windows.
                  It will not run under Desqview.

        Files required:
        POVDOC.ZIP - The documentation and essential data files for POV-Ray
        POVSCN.ZIP - The example scene files for POV-Ray
        POVIBM.EXE - Executable and docs for IBM-PC and compatibles

        You will also need a program like PICLAB or Image Alchemy to convert
        the TGA files output by POV-Ray to GIF files and a GIF viewer
        program. These programs can be found from any of the sources
        listed below.

        Optional Files:
        The source is not needed to use POV-Ray. It is provided for the
        curious and adventurous

        POVSRC.ZIP - The C source code for POV-Ray for most systems.
        POVSCR.SEA - Macintosh source code for POV-Ray.


     For Apple Macintosh:
     --------------------
        Requirements:
          The Apple Macintosh version of POV-Ray can be found in the
          archive POVMAC.SEA or POVMNF.SEA.  POVMAC.SEA contains the
          preferred "high-performance" executable for Macs with a floating
          point coprocessor (FPU).  POVMNF.SEA contains the slower more
          universal executable, which will run on any 68020 or better Mac
          without an FPU.  The Macintosh version of POV-Ray needs a 68020
          or better CPU (Mac II series, SE/30, Quadras, some Powerbooks,
          etc.)  It will run under Sytem 6.0.4 or newer (System 7 preferred.)
          It also requires 32 bit Color Quickdraw, which is built into System
          7, and is an optional init in System 6.

          QuickTime 1.5 or newer is preferred but not required.  If it is
          installed, it will allow compression of the final PICT images.
          It will also allow adding custom System 7 Thumbnail icons to the
          PICT files in the Finder.  Of course, a color monitor is preferred,
          but not required.

        Files Required:
          POVDOC.SEA - The documentation and essential data files for POV-Ray
          POVMAC.SEA - Regular executable and notes for Apple Macintosh
                       with FPU
          POVMNF.SEA - Generic (No FPU) Executable and notes for any
                       Macintosh
          POVSCN.SEA - The example scene files for POV-Ray

        Optional Files:
          POVSRC.SEA - The C source code for POV-Ray
                       (MPW 3.3 & Symantec C 6.0)

          This source code is not needed to use POV-Ray.  It is provided for
          the curious and adventurous.

     For Commodore Amiga:
     --------------------
        Requires: Amiga 500, 600, 1000, 1200, 2000, 3000 or 4000.  Works
                  under AmigaDOS 1.2, 1.3, 2.xx, and 3.xx.  Supports HAM6
                  mode as well as HAM-E and the Firecracker.

        Files Required:
        POVDOC.LZH - The documentation for POV-Ray.
        POVSCN.LZH - The example scene files for POV-Ray.
        POVAMI.LZH - Executable and docs for Commodore Amiga.

        Optional Files:
        The source is not needed to use POV-Ray.  It is provided for the
        curious and adventurous.

        POVSRC.LZH - The C source code for POV-Ray.

     For UNIX, VMS, & Others:
     ------------------
        Required: A C compiler for your computer and some knowledge
                  of how to use it.

        Optional: X Windows if you want the '+d' option to do anything.
                  Digital calls this 'DECWindows'.
                  You will need the DECWindows include files as well.
                  (The '+d' option lets you see a preview of a scene
                   as it is being traced).

        Files required:
        POVDOC.ZIP or POVDOC.TAR - The documentation for and essential data
                                    files POV-Ray
        POVSCN.ZIP or POVSCN.TAR - The example scene files for POV-Ray
        POVSRC.ZIP or POVSRC.TAR - The C source code for POV-Ray

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In the POVDOC archive is the file POVRAY.DOC which contains details
on installing and using POV-Ray. Specific instructions for
using POV-Ray with your computer are included with the executable.
This file also houses the essential "include" files containing predefed
colors, shapes, and textures.

 ** POV-Ray is copyrighted freeware written by the POV-Team.
 ** It may be freely distributed subject to the restrictions
 ** defined in POVLEGAL.DOC found in the POVDOC archive.
 ** POV-Ray is NOT public domain software.

 POV-Ray is based on DKBTrace 2.12 by David K. Buck and Aaron A. Collins.

   The POV-Team is a collection of volunteer programmers, designers,
animators and artists meeting via electronic mail on Compuserve's
GRAPHDEV forum, sections 8 (POV Sources), and 9 (POV Images).
(GRAPHDEV is also the home of the very popular Fractint and its authors the
Stone Soup Group.)

   The POV-Team's goal is to create freely distributable, high
quality rendering and animation software written in C that can be
easily ported to many different computers.
