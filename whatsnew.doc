    What's New in POV-Ray 2.1
    --------------------------

    This bug-fix release adds no new features but fixes the following
    bugs from version 2.0.

  - Fixed problem in OBJECTS.C that caused problem on some Unix compilers
  - Fixed problem with declared material_maps or declared objects with
    material_maps
  - Fixed IBM.C problems for Zortech compiler
  - Created temporary fix for problems with normals, smooth triangles
    beziers and height fields which created unsightly black spots
  - Allows scale <-1,1,1> to work with boxes
  - Cleared up inconsistency with -sr, -sc, -er, -ec numbering.  Upper
    left pixel is 1,1.  Fixed -ec bug.
  - Fixed three bezier patch bugs which caused lock-ups, missing reflection,
    and triangle dropouts.
  - Eliminated some restrictions on multiple clipped_by and bounded_by
  - Fixed compiler problems on VMS/VAX
  - Fixed scaling bug on degenerate triangles
  - Fixed problem with water_level when using +MV1.0
  - Fixed problem with color maped TGA height fields

    What's New in POV-Ray 2.0
    -------------------------
    The following is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of every
    new feature, but should give experienced users a pretty good guide
    of what has been changed and what has been added.  Please refer to
    POVRAY.DOC for details.


    General:
    -------
  - Automatic bounding slabs for greatly enhanced rendering speed of
    most scenes.
  - Adding, subtracting, multiplying & dividing of floats & vectors.
  - Clock global variable for external animation support.
  - X, Y, and Z global vector constants.
  - Improved antialiasing routine with new commandline options.

    Commandline options:
    -------------------
  - Version switch for backwards compatibility.
  - Starting/ending column/row switches for trace window.
  - Relative/absolute values for trace window switches.
  - Antialiasing jitter scale value and toggle.
  - Number of antialiasing rays to shoot.
  - Internal "clock" setting for animations.


    Objects:
    -------
  - Soft penumbral shadows from extended area lights.
  - Smoother Bezier patches.
  - New simplified torus syntax.
  - Heightfield water_level now uses range 0-1 instead of 0-255.
  - Heightfields can now be clipped and used in CSG operations.
  - Heightfields can be phong-shaded with the "smooth" option.
  - New, improved finite cylinders, cones, and discs, with
    optional "capping" of cones and cylinders.
  - More versatile CSG unions have replaced the need for composites.
  - CSG texturing has been made much more flexible.
  - New "merge" removes internal boundaries between transparent
    unioned objects.

    Textures:
    --------
  - Hexagon pigment texture.
  - Radial pigment texture.
  - Mandelbrot pigment texture.
  - Texture attributes grouped into 3 independently scalable groups:
    pigment, normal, and finish.
  - TIR (Total Internal Reflection) for more realistic refraction.
  - Fractional Brownian Motion (fbm) turbulence controls.
  - Turbulence can now be used independently with any pigment or normal
    texture.
  - Optional vector-style turbulence values.
  - Background coloring.
  - Color maps can now be declared.
  - Frequency, phase keywords now available for use with color_maps.
  - Filter keyword replaces "alpha", letting us reserve alpha for other
    uses in the future.
  - Less restrictive distribution policy.  See POVLEGAL.DOC for
    details.

    IBM PC Video:
    ------------
  - VESA 1.2 spec implemented for preview graphics in the IBM DOS version.
    Gives VESA support in most 8/15/24 bit modes.
    Should support: 1024 x 768 x 256 color palette
                     800 x 600 x  15 bit high color
                     640 x 480 x  24 bit true color
  - Diamond 24X 15 and 24 bit mode support added.
  - Preview reduced to fit selected video screen size if necessary.
